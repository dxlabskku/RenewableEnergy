1,Vailhem,coal,t5_2ri4i,"Almost like works of art aren't they?? I mean, it really is truly amazing what humans can do once they put their mind to it.

Just imagine if we put he same efforts towards less disruptive methods of coal extraction... how beautiful we could make thing!

after all, most activated carbon comes from [gasified](/r/gasification) coal and can be used as a substitute for [biochar](/r/biochar) when doing environmental clean up or restoration work... or just helping to expand the environmental quality in general...

...this, of course, coming *after* we've used the activated carbon for [water](/r/water) filtration to help those who would otherwise be drinking unclean water and dying from it (check out www.water.org for statistics if you don't already know) in the thousands....

Imagine how many more would be in their shoes if there *wasn't* activated carbon, again, mostly from coal, to purify that water for them, removing the nasties like e.coli, salmonella, etc etc.

2,Vailhem,coal,t5_2ri4i,"&gt; Using these data, the releases of radioactive materials per typical plant can be calculated for any year. For the year 1982, assuming coal contains uranium and thorium concentrations of 1.3 ppm and 3.2 ppm, respectively, each typical plant released 5.2 tons of uranium (containing 74 pounds of uranium-235) and 12.8 tons of thorium that year. Total U.S. releases in 1982 (from 154 typical plants) amounted to 801 tons of uranium (containing 11,371 pounds of uranium-235) and 1971 tons of thorium. These figures account for only 74% of releases from combustion of coal from all sources. Releases in 1982 from worldwide combustion of 2800 million tons of coal totaled 3640 tons of uranium (containing 51,700 pounds of uranium-235) and 8960 tons of thorium.

This section blew me away. I had no idea that the emissions from coal were so radioactive. There is so much energy being emitted out of coal plants, or at least was in 1993 when this was published, it's insane. Coal gasification make so much more sense.... and was a well understood technology even then, let alone in the decades since.

The ability to get so many valuable feedstocks from it... beyond just the hydrogen and activated carbon... baffles me that it's not done. It seems like any transition to a gasification model would more than pay for itself with the other raw materials it'd be able to provide the market.
esp if a thorium market ever takes off... or if these increased nuclear plants projections come true the uranium seems like it could easily allow for nice fuel sources.",1363020047

5,KovaaK,coal,t5_2ri4i,"The cost of running a fossil fuel plant ends up being tied largely to the fuel, but that isn't the case with nuclear.  Nuclear fuel ends up being next to nothing over the lifespan of a plant - the construction of the facility and general O&amp;M greatly dwarf the cost of fuel.

Simply put, we can get nuclear fuel almost anywhere (I frequently see people mentioning water in the ocean as being a viable source of uranium).  In my opinion, the next place we should go for it is the uranium that has already been through a thermal spectrum reactor (which is the type we use in the US, and most of the world).  The uranium we mine from the ground is 99.27% U238 and 0.72% U235.  We then enrich the fuel and increase the concentration of U235 to around 5% while ignoring the leftover U238.  In our thermal spectrum reactors, most of what we burn up is the U235, and the U238 remains largely unfissioned.

That's right - the fuel we put in our reactors is enough to power them for 1.5-2 years at a time, but we're still only burning ~5% of the fissionable fuel that we put it in (or 0.72% of what we mine).  When we move it to the spent fuel pool (and later dry cask storage) it's still just sitting there waiting to be fissioned.  There is no technical reason we couldn't reprocess that and send it to a fast spectrum reactor that is capable of fissioning U238 as well.  As a huge added bonus, fissioning that 'waste' (as we currently call it) means that instead of the fuel being above background levels of radiation for 10000 years, it only stays there for ~100-300 years.  It would make long term storage very easy, especially given the tiny quantities of waste that would be left after all of the reprocessing and fissioning.

Within the next 100 years, I'd be amazed if we didn't spend the time in reprocessing that spent fuel into something useable in fast spectrum reactors.",1363026224
6,Vailhem,coal,t5_2ri4i,"I've been arguing this for years. It just seems like such a waste to leave so much 'waste' lying around vs doing something useful with it.... like reducing it in quantity by.... powering my toaster!

It would also be nice to see some of those weapons dismantled and *their* fuel added into the mix as well. ",1363027039
7,Vailhem,coal,t5_2ri4i,"more likely replaced by something similar... technology has come a pretty long way since Ike announced that program.... though the fundamental principals are the same.

A lot of that program was set up with intentions of making fuel for bombs.. which is then what happened.... but I think we may have taken that a bit farther than 'needed'? &lt;shrug&gt;

It seems like it's about time we start taking apart some of those bombs that may be  a bit .....*excessive*? for what we'd need them for (delivery systems have become much much more advanced since... laying waste to entire cities, states, regions, countries even (in the case of the Tsar bomba) may be a bit... unnecessary given the shift in global politics since.... allowing for a bit more pin point accuracy.

Niclear war, and more importantly, Mutually Assured Destruction was an *excellent* deterrent ... and has been since... though, the only two with the real capabilities to do this are Russia and the US and... I think we've kind of proven the point to one another that ... well.... the US anyway has shown on more than one occasion that conventional weapons can near-completely destroy countries... or lay them to such waste as to break their will and bend them to it almost completely.... Japan, Germany, ... Vietnam, Iraq... not to mention the countless others that we use even less force and more tact against.... such as Hugo Chavez's claims that the US gave him cancer (technologically something that is *not* beyond the realm of possibility... likely? possibly... but evidence? unlikely.. those guys are pretty dang subtle... and the weapon system like that is pretty... fits pretty snugly inside the box of 'plausible deniability' and ... well, chaos theory... who's to say it wasn't going to happen anyway?)

As well, weapons systems like HAARP (actually overlapping with similar technology to the cancer causers) are capable of *far* more devastation than nuclear weapons anyway.... the ability to create and steer hurricanes unleashes huge magnitudes of energy... if you believe such things are done... possible? they seem to be, actively done? I can offer no direct evidence, of course, but I can say that some awfully strange things have been happening with the weather in the past decade or so... hurricanes that almost seem to 'steer' themselves directly into the points where they can wreak the most havoc? ... ex: Katrina steered right into the oil infrastructure in Louisana and Southeastern Tx.... infrastructure who's leases and government approvals were expiring.. and *not* being granted extensions or new approval contracts... yet, when Katrina happened... it became *necessary* for the US to rebuild the infrastructure... all to the new code-specs that otherwise allows them to last for decades longer.... coincidence? who knows. 

but, the point is... technological capability and understanding of the science behind it all has advanced a lot in the past 50-60 years since that program was announced... but, even despite this, the fundamental principals are still in place.

There is no real limit (from a human perspective) on the amounts of nuclear fuel available. ... and much of the technology to utilize it ...and *safely* at that.... has either existed in physical presence or at least on the drawing board for a *very* long time... it only requires a will and a political 'push' to begin using it.... as such, the planet seems much more organized around other... means.... unfortunately... as those means aren't quite as... well... solar, tidal, wind, geothermal, etc... seem pretty unlimited (from a human perspective)... fusion seems to have been proven capable by Bussard before his death... the biofuel capability from algae and switchgrass and other feedstocks clearly exists... and, then, nuclear... uranium... *plutonium*....  then there's the [thorium](/r/thorium)... in abundance on orders of magnitude more than the previous two combined... and there's always the chance to breed yet *more* of each of them to, in turn, breed yet more of whatever elements allow for *that* breeding to happen.... all while *also* getting every last 'drop' of energy or use out of the fuel before it's 'discarded' 'safely' as waste... 'waste' that has a much much shorter half life than the original material... which, if memory serves, was radioactive when we pulled it from the ground to begin with... it's safe in the ground as long as we don't touch it... but as soon as we touch it, someone become accountable. 

Wonder what all of those anti-nuclear people would think if we simply rediluted down the waste back to pretty close to its original form and tried to put it back where we got it?

lol... I bet they wouldn't be so high and mighty about nature and all of it's 'natural glory' *then*... no, they'd probably be *begging* for long term storage areas (like Yucca... which is really just where nuclear fuel (currently called 'waste') goes to die... ie, become locked up in one central place and buried so deeply that we'd have to go through so much red tape to get it out that it might as well remain there permanently... unlike the oil that's stored in the salt mines in southern Louisana that has been geologically stable for 250 *million* years, and is set to be so for 10x that much longer... asteroids, earthquakes, exploding suns, melting ice caps, etc included))

sorry, that was a bit of a rant, but, in short, I agree, breeding fuel in a much cleaner way seems a very likely path forward... politics allowing",1363070924

&gt; In addition to United Coal, the forum is being hosted by the CEOs of five other coal companies: Alliance Resource Partners, Alpha Natural Resources, Consol Energy, Drummond Company, and Arch Coal.

&gt; Having long bemoaned of a &amp;quot;War on coal,&amp;quot; facing massive losses in share value, and the likely closure of many coal plants under the Clean Power Plan, the coal industry must be looking to Jeb Bush as a potential ally.

29,jdmgto,coal,t5_2ri4i,"&gt;When a plant modernizes to meet new standards, what are the main changes they are doing?


That’s, complicated. There are a lot of pollution standards to meet and not all apply to all plants. Depending on the plant they might be able to just add a few pieces of equipment or they might have to retrofit the entire operation.


Scrubbers are typically utilized to remove sulphur dioxide. There’s not much else to add to control SO2 aside from switching to a lower sulphur coal. The only problem there is the truly low sulphur coals like powder river basin require major changes to the boiler to accommodate it and it's simply not economic to do it in most cases. Thankfully scrubber technology has advanced and most plants won’t have to switch coals. The downside is that for a 500 MW boiler the cost of a scrubber can be in excess of $100 million dollars.


Nitrous oxides can be alleviated with the addition of a selective catalytic reducer. This device is similar to what you have in your car and a catalyst combined with a reagent will react with the nitrous oxides to reduce them to nitrogen and water. The downside is again cost with a 500MW plant needing to spend upwards of $120 million on an SCR along with yearly catalyst purchases and reagent purchases. NOx can also be handed with combustion optimization but you are limited based off the unit’s original design. Burner change outs can significantly lower NOx but they won’t meet upcoming guidelines, they can help though. A full burner change out on a 500MW unit will run you around $5 million.


Other pollutants such as mercury or acid gas require the addition of additive feeds such as activated carbon and lime which cost around $3 to $5 million per unit along with the associated cost of purchasing the additives.


&gt;is there any way where it's just as cheap to use coal vs. natural gas? Is it easy for these plants to switch between natural gas and coal?


No. Coal and natural gas are two very different fuels with very different characteristics. Coal is primarily a radiant heat whereas natural gas is convective. Boilers have to be designed specifically to handle the particular fuel you’re burning. If you tried to burn natural gas in a boiler designed for coal it will be very inefficient. You can do it, but the unit will be derated significantly (a 500 MW rated coal boiler might only be able to produce 350MW on gas), still have much of the equivalent overhead costs, and simply not be as efficient as a purpose built gas boiler or better yet a combustion turbine with a heat recovery steam generator. The reverse, trying to burn coal in a natural gas boiler, it’s a very bad idea. Introducing a solid fuel to them will just about ruin them.


Fuel switching is occasionally done, but it’s rarely economically driven and can’t be done quickly.",1452713690

You might get a 15% increase but that would be largely dependant upon the steam turbines which don’t require demolishing the boilers.


As for “just build new ones,” a plant of that size is going to cost about $2.5 to 3 billion dollars to replace. Even if you could find the money that’s only half the battle, you’d have to get the permits and that’s not a given with the EPA.",1462469833

&gt; A new surface coal mine could be created on the scenic Northumberland coast if an application is approved next month.

&gt; There are a number of proposals in the planning pipeline for opencast coal mines in England and Wales, totalling 11Mt:. Nant Llesg, South Wales: 6Mt. Highthorn, Northumberland: 3Mt. Tower Colliery, South Wales: 1.2Mt. Dewley Hill, Newcastle: 800,000t.

&gt; In August 2015, Caerphilly council rejected plans for the 6Mt coal mine at Nant Llesg, citing visual impacts as its reasons for rejection, with a strong consideration of the climate change impacts and impact on the local community by council members.

57,Gary-FWG,coal,t5_2ri4i,"Good Afternoon ,

Let me introduce myself, I am Gary Monaghan, one of the Managing Partners at Forward Working Generation Ltd in the UK. I am writing today to submit a news story for your consideration. Let me give you a brief outline of FWG, who we are and what this news story is about. Forward Working Generation is a producer of world changing Intellectual Property, we are currently working on three interrelated technologies.

1) An advanced carbon battery that is showing a result of 475 mWh/g on the industry standard Cadex 8000 machine. This will shortly go to verification and pilot line for certification. The result is about double the highest performing battery in the world.

2) A technology that uniformly distributes graphene through cement producing from initial testing a 42% increase in strength or in another measure, the ability to reduce the amount of cement used in construction by 1/3.

and

3) The attention for the news story I am contacting you on today is  - we have developed a technology that can take coal from a controversial , CO2 contributor, marginal resource at $40.00 USD per tonne, apply our technology and process and convert this ample US resource into Graphite and Graphene. Common graphite is valued at approximately $2000 USD per Tonne and Spherical graphite which is the type of graphite used by Tesla's Lithium Battery gigafactory is approximately $20,000 USD per tonne. Tesla is expecting 28,000 Tonnes to be used in his first year of operating. With all the auto manufacturers following Tesla's lead in the electric car, there will be a large amount of graphite required for this market. It is estimated that  the lithium-ion battery graphite - anode market could grow to at least 250,000 tonnes by end-2020.

So coal and coal spoils to graphite and graphene - Original resource of coal at $40.00 per tonne , processing to graphite at $10.00 per tonne and resulting in a product that is in high demand valued as high as $20,000 per tonne. This technology will put the US at par with China who has the largest supply of graphite in the world but the second largest coal supplies and will put areas of the US such as the Pennsylvania coal areas back to work . The US coal history is very well known and recently President Trump has made the coal industry very topical. Wouldn't a solution to the problem of coal and its potential economic impact also be topical.

Dr. Robert Murray-Smith is one of the world's leading experts on Graphene and one of the Managing Partners at FWG. He recently produced a video on his You Tube channel that you can use for reference. Here is the link to that story:

&gt; Natural gas will reap $804 billion, bringing 16 percent more generation capacity and making the fuel central to balancing a grid that&amp;#039;s increasingly dependent on power flowing from intermittent sources, like wind and solar.

&gt; Onshore wind, which has dropped 30 percent in price in the past eight years, will fall another 47 percent by the end of BNEF&amp;#039;s forecast horizon.

&gt; By 2040, wind and solar will make up almost half of the world&amp;#039;s installed generation capacity, up from just 12 percent now, and account for 34 percent of all the power generated, compared with 5 percent at the moment, BNEF concluded.

&gt; Last week, Trump&amp;#039;s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, &amp;quot;The war on coal is over.&amp;quot; If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost.

&gt; As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word.

&gt; Then just a few weeks ago, Trump&amp;#039;s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open.

""Solar coupled with storage technologies could alleviate, and possibly eliminate, the risk of over-generation. Curtailment isn’t necessary when excess energy can be stored for use during peak electricity demand. SETO launched several projects in 2016 that pair researchers with utilities to examine how storage could make it easier for utilities to rely on solar energy to meet customer needs around the clock. This research will enable even more solar energy to be integrated into the grid, while tackling the obstacles utilities face when incorporating solar.

In 2012, SETO also launched a research program that helped utilities, grid operators, and solar power plant owners to better predict when, where, and how much solar power will be produced. More accurate solar power predictions, known as forecasts, allow utilities and electric system operators to better understand generation patterns and maximize solar resources. One key success came from IBM, whose machine-learning technology enabled prediction accuracy to be improved by 30%. However, as the amount of solar energy generation connected to our electric grid continues to grow at a rapid rate, further improvements in predictive accuracy will be needed.""

86,danfoss5000,coal,t5_2ri4i,"I think they could do several things:

* Assess whether they could wash the coal differently (reduce ash or other impurities) or blend their coal with another local mine that exports thru the same port to create a different product (ie a met coal product for steel making or higher energy lower ash thermal product) to make more profit.
* Do a bit further exploration of the resource to determine if there is deeper or further away seams that may have different types of coal that can be mined.
* Explore other global customer bases (ie export more to overseas customers to offset falling domestic demand)
* Re-negotiate any major contracts with suppliers (labour hire, rail, port, diesel, electricity supply) to reduce costs.

Also note there seems to be a lot of misinformation about coal demand falling away to nothing in the near future, may be the case in US and Europe but certainly not in Asian developing countries (for both met coal and thermal coal).

This doesn't have to happen all at once, the rate at which coal demand is going to decline will be gradual, which means a coal company can start small and scale up.",1541629450

Some positives about coal: 

\-Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite. Pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulphuric acid and dissolved iron, and as water washes through mines, this compound forms a dilute acid, which can wash into nearby rivers and streams.\[1\]

\-Air pollution from coal-fired power plants includes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM), and heavy metals, leading to smog, acid rain, toxins in the environment, and numerous respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular effects.\[2\]

\-Air pollution from coal mines is mainly due to emissions of particulate matter and gases including methane (CH4), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as carbon monoxide (CO).\[3\]

\-Climate impacts of coal plants - Coal-fired power plants are responsible for one-third of America’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making coal a huge contributor to global warming.\[4\] Black carbon resulting from incomplete combustion is an additional contributor to climate change.\[5\]

\-Coal dust stirred up during the mining process, as well as released during coal transport, which can cause severe and potentially deadly respiratory problems.\[6\]

\-Coal fires occur in both abandoned coal mines and coal waste piles. Internationally, thousands of underground coal fires are burning now. Global coal fire emissions are estimated to include 40 tons of mercury going into the atmosphere annually, and three percent of the world's annual carbon dioxide emissions.\[7\]\[8\]

\-Coal combustion waste is the nation's second largest waste stream after municipal solid waste.\[9\] It is disposed of in landfills or ""surface impoundments,"" which are lined with compacted clay soil, a plastic sheet, or both. As rain filters through the toxic ash pits year after year, the toxic metals are leached out into the local environment.\[10\]\[11\]

\-Coal sludge, also known as slurry, is the liquid coal waste generated by washing coal. It is typically disposed of at impoundments located near coal mines, but in some cases it is directly injected into abandoned underground mines. Since coal sludge contains toxins, leaks or spills can endanger underground and surface waters.\[2\]

\-Floods such as the Buffalo Creek Flood caused by mountaintop removal mining and failures of coal mine impoundments.

\-Forest destruction caused by mountaintop removal mining - According to a 2010 study, mountaintop removal mining has destroyed 6.8% of Appalachia's forests.\[12\]\[13\]

\-Greenhouse gas emissions caused by surface mining - According to a 2010 study, mountaintop removal mining releases large amounts of carbon through clearcutting and burning of trees and through releases of carbon in soil brought to the surface by mining operations. These greenhouse gas emissions amount to at least 7% of conventional power plant emissions.\[14\]\[15\]

\-Loss or degradation of groundwater - Since coal seams are often serve as underground aquifers, removal of coal beds may result in drastic changes in hydrology after mining has been completed.

\-Radical disturbance of 8.4 million acres of farmland, rangeland, and forests, most of which has not been reclaimed -- See The footprint of coal

\-Heavy metals and coal - Coal contains many heavy metals, as it is created through compressed organic matter containing virtually every element in the periodic table - mainly carbon, but also heavy metals. The heavy metal content of coal varies by coal seam and geographic region. Small amounts of heavy metals can be necessary for health, but too much may cause acute or chronic toxicity (poisoning). Many of the heavy metals released in the mining and burning of coal are environmentally and biologically toxic elements, such as lead, mercury, nickel, tin, cadmium, antimony, and arsenic, as well as radio isotopes of thorium and strontium.\[16\]\[17\]\[18\]

\-Mercury and coal - Emissions from coal-fired power plants are the largest source of mercury in the United States, accounting for about 41 percent (48 tons in 1999) of industrial releases.\[19\]

\-Methane released by coal mining accounts for about 10 percent of US releases of methane (CH4), a potent global warming gas.\[20\]

\-Mountaintop removal mining and other forms of surface mining can lead to the drastic alteration of landscapes, destruction of habitat, damages to water supplies, and air pollution. Not all of these effects can be adequately addressed through coal mine reclamation.

\-Particulates and coal - Particulate matter (PM) includes the tiny particles of fly ash and dust that are expelled from coal-burning power plants.\[21\] Studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter is related to an increase of respiratory and cardiac mortality.\[22\] \[23\]

\-Radioactivity and coal - Coal contains minor amounts of the radioactive elements, uranium and thorium. When coal is burned, the fly ash contains uranium and thorium ""at up to 10 times their original levels.""\[24\]

\-Subsidence - Land subsidence may occur after any type of underground mining, but it is particularly common in the case of longwall mining.\[25\]

\-Sulfur dioxide and coal - Coal-fired power plants are the largest human-caused source of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant gas that contributes to the production of acid rain and causes significant health problems. Coal naturally contains sulfur, and when coal is burned, the sulfur combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides.\[26\]

\-Thermal pollution from coal plants is the degradation of water quality by power plants and industrial manufacturers - when water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by decreasing oxygen supply, and affecting ecosystem composition.\[27\]

\-Toxins - According to a July 2011 NRDC report, ""How Power Plants Contaminate Our Air and States"" electricity generation in the U.S. releases 381,740,601 lbs. of toxic air pollution annually, or 49% of total national emissions, based on data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (2009 data, accessed June 2011). Power plants are the leading sources of toxic air pollution in all but four of the top 20 states by electric sector emissions.

\-Transportation - Coal is often transported via trucks, railroads, and large cargo ships, which release air pollution such as soot and can lead to disasters that ruin the environment, such as the Shen Neng 1 coal carrier collision with the Great Barrier Reef, Australia that occurred in April 2010.

\-Waste coal, also known as ""culm,"" ""gob,"" or ""boney,"" is made up of unused coal mixed with soil and rock from previous mining operations. Runoff from waste coal sites can pollute local water supplies.\[28\]

\-Water consumption from coal plants - Power generation has been estimated to be second only to agriculture in being the largest domestic user of water.\[29\]

\-Water pollution from coal includes the negative health and environmental effects from the mining, processing, burning, and waste storage of coal.",1598460406

Having GAS on a western exchange reduces our risk that a new DApp can't get their hands on some.,1516900213
6,dyzzodyzzo,Gas,t5_2qk1n,You mean gas should be more expensive than neo? If so then gas is so undervalued right now. The trend was 50% of NEO.. even then its still low now. Im about to buy some.,1516240429
7,Somebody__Online,Gas,t5_2qk1n,I'm confused is this sub for gas like petroleum to power your vehicle or is it gas crypto currency used on the neo network,1528339980

10,Reviken,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"NEON wallet is great. Just save your private public key, and remember to never, ever, EVER, share your private key with anyone. I recommend a paper wallet. You don't need to log in to do anything after you transfer your NEO/GAS.",1504839626
11,GlitchingSince1993,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"In the old gas stations yes, but now that everything is computerized the only thing controlled on the inside is if you pay inside and or if you lift the nozzle without paying first.     It's possible for the cashier to turn off the pup but they do not activate it for each card slid in the machine. ",1540336605
12,icelade67,Gas,t5_2qk1n,I finally love having GAS,1504902573
13,lecryptokeeper,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"This is probably not the sub you think it is.  This sub is for the gas crypto currency.coin that will power the NEO digital economy platform.

 I know nothing about your meter, but if it has buttons accessible to random public you probably can't do too much wrong to it.  Your neighbors meter is likely just fine and will reset itself after some time.",1507412892
14,KnowledgeSupreme,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"Yes, tried sending from my other one last night. Didn't work on that one either. I'm able to claim gas, and receive Neo, but I keep getting the error message whenever I try to send gas, and the notification to confirm the transaction never shows up on the ledger.",1518705442
15,Edgecloser,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"What is GAS? From what I understand it GAS generated when a block is mined on NEO. 

Why should one own GAS? Can you buy NEO or is GAS equivalent to NEO?",1514423945
16,Coogz21,Gas,t5_2qk1n,Haha.. Wonder if they can install a big pipe to connect a gas faucet in my study? ,1523360793
17,gloriser,Gas,t5_2qk1n,"I downloaded and started ""drives"" but nothing happened.  I deleted the app and will only add it again once I get the discount gas card.  ",1543793435
18,Dreadweave,Gas,t5_2qk1n,Why do Americans call Petrol Gas anyway? Is it like slang? I see it in American movies and it’s always a little confusing until I realise they mean fuel,1528370545
19,ultimacorp,Gas,t5_2qk1n,Gas very steady HODL slow and low but time is friend,1515953421
