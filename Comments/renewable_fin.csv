DOE Wind Program Selects Seven Projects to Demonstrate Next-Generation Offshore Wind Technologies

December 12, 2012

The Energy Department today announced seven offshore wind awards for projects in Maine, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia. As part of the Energy Department's broader efforts to launch an offshore wind industry in the United States, these engineering, design, and deployment projects will support innovative offshore installations in state and federal waters for commercial operation by 2017.

In the initial phase, each project will receive up to $4 million to complete the engineering, design and permitting phase of this award. The Department will select up to three of these projects for follow-on phases that focus on siting, construction, and installation and aim to achieve commercial operation by 2017. These projects will receive up to $47 million over four years, subject to congressional appropriations.

The seven projects selected for the first phase of this six-year initiative include:

* Baryonyx Corporation, based in Austin, Texas, plans to install three 6-megawatt direct-drive wind turbines in state waters near Port Isabel, Texas. The project will demonstrate an advanced jacket foundation design and integrate lessons learned from the oil and gas sector on hurricane-resistant facility design, installation procedures, and personnel safety.

* Fishermen's Atlantic City Windfarm plans to install up to six direct-drive turbines in state waters three miles off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey. The project will result in an advanced bottom-mounted foundation design and innovative installation procedures to mitigate potential environmental impacts. The company expects this project to achieve commercial operation by 2015.

* Lake Erie Development Corporation, a regional public-private partnership based in Cleveland, Ohio, plans to install nine 3-megawatt direct-drive wind turbines on ""ice breaker"" monopile foundations designed to reduce ice loading. The project will be installed on Lake Erie, seven miles off the coast of Cleveland.

* Seattle, Washington-based Principle Power plans to install five semi-submersible floating foundations outfitted with 6-megawatt direct-drive offshore wind turbines. The project will be sited in deep water 10 to 15 miles from Coos Bay, Oregon. Principle Power's semi-submersible foundations will be assembled near the project site in Oregon, helping to reduce installation costs.

* Statoil North America of Stamford, Connecticut plans to deploy four 3-megawatt wind turbines on floating spar buoy structures in the Gulf of Maine off Boothbay Harbor at a water depth of approximately 460 feet. These spar buoys will be assembled in harbor to reduce installation costs and then towed to the installation site to access the Gulf of Maine's extensive deep water offshore wind resources.

* The University of Maine, based in Orono, plans to install a pilot floating offshore wind farm with two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines on concrete semi-submersible foundations near Monhegan Island. These concrete foundations could result in improvements in commercial-scale production and provide offshore wind projects with a cost-effective alternative to traditional steel foundations.

* Dominion Virginia Power of Richmond plans to design, develop, and install two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach on innovative ""twisted jacket"" foundations that offer the strength of traditional jacket or space-frame structures but use substantially less steel. 

Offshore wind represents a large, untapped energy resource for the United States, offering over 4,000 gigawatts of clean, domestic electricity potential—four times the nation's current total generation capacity. According to a new reportPDF commissioned by the Energy Department, a U.S. offshore wind industry that takes advantage of this abundant domestic resource could support up to 200,000 manufacturing, construction, operation, and supply chain jobs across the country and drive over $70 billion in annual investments by 2030. Offshore wind represents an economic and energy opportunity that could mirror the success of land-based wind development. ",1355414666.0
8,cnbll1895,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;I want to work in the field that has the most potential to replace fossil fuels as the primary energy source of the world.

Why should wind or solar be the primary energy source? It is sensible to have diverse sources of energy and both will continue to be developed and implemented where each is best suited. Wind or solar would both be good fields to get into in Germany. 

It's also not like you're stuck doing your first job for the rest of your life. If a good opportunity comes along, take it. Don't try to plan for some imagined distant energy future where only solar panels or only wind turbines are used. Just pick the job you will find the most fulfilling and don't worry so much about what the energy situation will be like in 40 years.

edit: I will be going into offshore O&amp;G in Europe for the time being but sometime in the future I would maybe like to go into offshore wind (particularly if it gains a stronger footing in the US).

Edit: Most big name manufactureres will only hire from within. Places like GE require 10 years experience before being considered for their wind sector. 

I was thinking I would have a better chance at getting in with a smaller company that does maintance and repair contracts for wind sites.

12,ZEnterprises,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I have had an interesting path to get to where I am today.

After working labor jobs in construction, I eventually landed an engineering tech job completely by chance. This job made me realize that I wanted to/ needed to go back to school. I didn't know for what. After a year or two, I chose engineering because I do really well in the core classes. I pursued ME because it has the best diversity and I still didn't know what I wanted to do.

About 2 years ago, when transferring to WSU, I finally narrowed it down to solar or wind. 

Why wind? It has a future. Wind turbines excite me. Oh and I saw a ""Dirty Jobs"" on wind turbines and I told myself that job is for me, specifically inspection of the turbines. Design is all well and good, but turbine design, although advanced, is simply scale. The nacelles themselves have not changed technology, just gotten bigger.

I don't think I fully explained my goals. I would like to work in operations and maintenance of wind sites. I am not interested in design. In fact, I think you hit the nail on the head with ""wandering adventure seekers"". I have been a raft guide, involved in many outdoor sports and recently just certified as a P2 paraglider!

My BS in ME means to me that I can learn fast and learn well. That is what I hope it means to future employers. 

I am looking for an entry level job that may not require a degree. Once my foot is in the door doing anything in wind, in 3-5 years I'll be a great candidate for associate wind site manager, and then in another 2-3 years, step up to wind site manager.

GE wants new grads to go to Alaska. Oil and gas is all I get from GE and similar energy companies. Oil and gas. I want to contribute to the future success of this planet, not contribute to the destruction that comes from burning fossil fuels.

In short, I am not looking for a ""typical"" engineering job. I value career satisfaction and a clear conscious over money.

To this end, I hope to find any position in the operations and maintenance of wind turbines.

I have tried cold calling a couple of wind sites as well as emailing several people directly. This has not been beneficial and seemed to only frustrate those that I called or emailed.

I have found several associate wind site manager positions posted online.  These appear to be entry level. I have applied to over 200 jobs in the past week, so far 10 rejections from that group. I am putting in the leg work. Could I be getting rejected because I am looking for employment 7 months from now?

People might not necessarily choose the GE for every project though.  For one thing it is not going to survive in the windiest climates unless they meet particular conditions (low turbulence intensity, flat terrain so the wind hits the rotor in a nice perpendicular fashion).  Another might be if you wish to build a large project (in terms of installed MW), but have a smallish amount of land, you'd want more megawatts per machine than 1.7.

20,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;VAWTS are a better design.   

Personal taste might drown brain-activity.    

HAWT-blades are always running at at the ~~right~~ correct angle to the wind, VAWT's always have a surface going into the wind, making it unlikely they will ever be as efficient.   

Having said that, **not** having your generator and stuff on top of the mast, but at ground-level, makes maintenance a lot easier, and getting rid of the 'into the wind' mechanical stuff is a nice extra.   

As OP is ""looking into building"", for 1st time experimenters, VAWT's are much more forgiving than the rather critical wing-shape needed for HAWT's.

21,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Uh... some confusion, I think.  
HAWT blades at the ~~right~~ correct angle to the wind, compare with airplane wings, there is *always* a functional airflow, producing power.   

&gt; which requires additional gearing.   

The VAWT-axis is vertical, which you can extend to ground level, connect to a 'vertical' axis generator, and no gearbox is needed (technically).  
The VAWT-rpm is low, if you have a highspeed generator you do need one.

tl;dr: if you speed up the wind, you lower the density.  
    
[Betz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27_law) is another guy with some strong opinion on this.        
tl;dr: energy depends on density.   
   
That double-trumpet-like contraption in the 2nd picture is supposed to act as a venturi, but with all the open space around it (with lower air-resistance), well, that's where the wind is going.   
  
The 3rd picture makes more sense (airflow-wise), but the 2 90⁰ bends cause a lot of friction, lowering airspeed,   
and for the energy-calculation: P=0.5 x density x area x windspeed³,    
you still have to use outside windspeed and that large trumpet-area.   
(However, it is possible you get some extra vacuum inside).   
 
The HAWT-part is a proper venturi, but with higher windspeed, the only thing they manage to do is shrinking the turbine proper.   
That, of course, gives them bragging rights:  
3 times as much energy compared to a similar blade-sized turbine.   

Edit: just looked at the 9th picture.   
With all that unrestricted airspace available, why would the wind voluntairily make a 90⁰ bend down, and try to escape through a tiny hole at the other end?

Due to the convex/concave curves, the drag from 'into the wind' is less then the 'tailwind' blade, so yes, your proposed construction will work, and due to the up-down slope, it will probably run smoother then a Savonius.   

However, you did mention 'efficiency', hence the Lenz2 reference, but if you only want the helix type, ok, either keep searching 'the net' for more info/answers, or just build it.

25,DGS83,wind,t5_2qyr2,"With early designs of wind turbines in the 70’s and 80’s there was indeed a problem with avian mortality, with a avian mortality rate of 20 per turbine a year, this was due to two reasons, firstly the design of the turbine towers, the use of a lattice frame encouraged birds to perch or even nest on the turbines, this has been rectified with the use of tube towers and designing the nacelles with no surfaces which can be used for nesting or perching, this has ceased to be a problem since the early 90’s. The second issue was due to the swept area of the turbine blades, the smaller turbines of the 70’s and 80’s having a much decreased swept area they needed a higher RPM to generate efficiently, as turbines have got larger and the swept area of the blades has increased the easier it is for birds to avoid the blades. Currently the average mortality rate per turbine is 1-2 a year, with some sights recording less than one a year per turbine a year. As the next generation of turbines are about to come onto the market, with the Siemens D6 6MW platform and the Vestas 8Mw platform looking like being the market leaders being designed for instillation up to 70km offshore the risk of avian mortality is reduced even more. The Avian mortality rate is something that has been used repeatedly by the anti-turbine lobby repeatedly here in the UK, along with other arguments such as the mechanical and aerodynamic noise, the electromagnetic interference and the visual impact, the only argument that can hold water is the visual impact one, and that is subjective, I personally like the look of turbines, others don’t like the look of them, it’s all a matter of personal opinion, although I would respect the anti-turbine lobby more if they used up to date data and admitted that their objections to turbine are purely down to aesthetics, nothing more.

If you don't feel like reading the whole article though, in summary it seems to be mostly to reduce the overall weight of the machine by removing a superfluous blade. Also noise reduction isn't as important offshore as on. Seems like the argument comes down to something like ""why order three blades per turbine if we can do just as well with two?"" Even if it doesn't save much money for the overall wind project, it's one less piece that needs to be transported offshore. 

Why three blades are popular, particularly onshore, has to do with the wind speeds required to achieve peak efficiency. Two blade machines need to rotate faster. More importantly the slower yawing operations of a three-blader puts less strain on the overall machine.

They'll even work with you to pay for physical barriers to the radar to block beampath to noncritical areas of the radar's coverage area so that wind turbines on the border of causing scatter on the radar's returns will be non-issues.

I'm not sure if the increased performance is in line with that of multistage gas turbines. To be honest, I don't enough about them to give you a good answer.

There are legitimate concerns about increased  fatigue loading with the addition of a second rotor. Anytime you add a moving component to a machine, you are likely to have issues. Right now, we are performing an aeromechanical analysis using FAST. We want to see how the turbulence generated from the secondary rotor will effect the fatigue loading on the primary rotor. It is still early to draw conclusions, but it looks like there really isn't that much of a difference between a conventional HAWT and our DRWT.

There is no doubt that a shroud would increase the efficiency even more. It would just be incredibly hard to manufacture on such a large scale. I could definitely see smaller DRWTs with shrouds in the future though.

DOE Wind Program Selects Seven Projects to Demonstrate Next-Generation Offshore Wind Technologies

December 12, 2012

The Energy Department today announced seven offshore wind awards for projects in Maine, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia. As part of the Energy Department's broader efforts to launch an offshore wind industry in the United States, these engineering, design, and deployment projects will support innovative offshore installations in state and federal waters for commercial operation by 2017.

In the initial phase, each project will receive up to $4 million to complete the engineering, design and permitting phase of this award. The Department will select up to three of these projects for follow-on phases that focus on siting, construction, and installation and aim to achieve commercial operation by 2017. These projects will receive up to $47 million over four years, subject to congressional appropriations.

The seven projects selected for the first phase of this six-year initiative include:

* Baryonyx Corporation, based in Austin, Texas, plans to install three 6-megawatt direct-drive wind turbines in state waters near Port Isabel, Texas. The project will demonstrate an advanced jacket foundation design and integrate lessons learned from the oil and gas sector on hurricane-resistant facility design, installation procedures, and personnel safety.

* Fishermen's Atlantic City Windfarm plans to install up to six direct-drive turbines in state waters three miles off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey. The project will result in an advanced bottom-mounted foundation design and innovative installation procedures to mitigate potential environmental impacts. The company expects this project to achieve commercial operation by 2015.

* Lake Erie Development Corporation, a regional public-private partnership based in Cleveland, Ohio, plans to install nine 3-megawatt direct-drive wind turbines on ""ice breaker"" monopile foundations designed to reduce ice loading. The project will be installed on Lake Erie, seven miles off the coast of Cleveland.

* Seattle, Washington-based Principle Power plans to install five semi-submersible floating foundations outfitted with 6-megawatt direct-drive offshore wind turbines. The project will be sited in deep water 10 to 15 miles from Coos Bay, Oregon. Principle Power's semi-submersible foundations will be assembled near the project site in Oregon, helping to reduce installation costs.

* Statoil North America of Stamford, Connecticut plans to deploy four 3-megawatt wind turbines on floating spar buoy structures in the Gulf of Maine off Boothbay Harbor at a water depth of approximately 460 feet. These spar buoys will be assembled in harbor to reduce installation costs and then towed to the installation site to access the Gulf of Maine's extensive deep water offshore wind resources.

* The University of Maine, based in Orono, plans to install a pilot floating offshore wind farm with two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines on concrete semi-submersible foundations near Monhegan Island. These concrete foundations could result in improvements in commercial-scale production and provide offshore wind projects with a cost-effective alternative to traditional steel foundations.

* Dominion Virginia Power of Richmond plans to design, develop, and install two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach on innovative ""twisted jacket"" foundations that offer the strength of traditional jacket or space-frame structures but use substantially less steel. 

Offshore wind represents a large, untapped energy resource for the United States, offering over 4,000 gigawatts of clean, domestic electricity potential—four times the nation's current total generation capacity. According to a new reportPDF commissioned by the Energy Department, a U.S. offshore wind industry that takes advantage of this abundant domestic resource could support up to 200,000 manufacturing, construction, operation, and supply chain jobs across the country and drive over $70 billion in annual investments by 2030. Offshore wind represents an economic and energy opportunity that could mirror the success of land-based wind development. ",1355414666.0
11,cnbll1895,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;I want to work in the field that has the most potential to replace fossil fuels as the primary energy source of the world.

Why should wind or solar be the primary energy source? It is sensible to have diverse sources of energy and both will continue to be developed and implemented where each is best suited. Wind or solar would both be good fields to get into in Germany. 

It's also not like you're stuck doing your first job for the rest of your life. If a good opportunity comes along, take it. Don't try to plan for some imagined distant energy future where only solar panels or only wind turbines are used. Just pick the job you will find the most fulfilling and don't worry so much about what the energy situation will be like in 40 years.

edit: I will be going into offshore O&amp;G in Europe for the time being but sometime in the future I would maybe like to go into offshore wind (particularly if it gains a stronger footing in the US).

After working labor jobs in construction, I eventually landed an engineering tech job completely by chance. This job made me realize that I wanted to/ needed to go back to school. I didn't know for what. After a year or two, I chose engineering because I do really well in the core classes. I pursued ME because it has the best diversity and I still didn't know what I wanted to do.

About 2 years ago, when transferring to WSU, I finally narrowed it down to solar or wind. 

Why wind? It has a future. Wind turbines excite me. Oh and I saw a ""Dirty Jobs"" on wind turbines and I told myself that job is for me, specifically inspection of the turbines. Design is all well and good, but turbine design, although advanced, is simply scale. The nacelles themselves have not changed technology, just gotten bigger.

I don't think I fully explained my goals. I would like to work in operations and maintenance of wind sites. I am not interested in design. In fact, I think you hit the nail on the head with ""wandering adventure seekers"". I have been a raft guide, involved in many outdoor sports and recently just certified as a P2 paraglider!

My BS in ME means to me that I can learn fast and learn well. That is what I hope it means to future employers. 

I am looking for an entry level job that may not require a degree. Once my foot is in the door doing anything in wind, in 3-5 years I'll be a great candidate for associate wind site manager, and then in another 2-3 years, step up to wind site manager.

GE wants new grads to go to Alaska. Oil and gas is all I get from GE and similar energy companies. Oil and gas. I want to contribute to the future success of this planet, not contribute to the destruction that comes from burning fossil fuels.

In short, I am not looking for a ""typical"" engineering job. I value career satisfaction and a clear conscious over money.

To this end, I hope to find any position in the operations and maintenance of wind turbines.

I have tried cold calling a couple of wind sites as well as emailing several people directly. This has not been beneficial and seemed to only frustrate those that I called or emailed.

I have found several associate wind site manager positions posted online.  These appear to be entry level. I have applied to over 200 jobs in the past week, so far 10 rejections from that group.

As I understand it, to participate in short-term trades like the hour-ahead market the wind producer has to be able to guarantee a level of reliability. If there is excess power and some is stored in batteries the operator can say, ""Even though wind is intermittent over the next hour, I have enough stored energy to continue participating in the short-term trade energy market.""

However, if the operator were to install additional turbines rather than storage as the study's authors suggest, the operator would say, ""I have more power but the next hour seems intermittent. I can't guarantee a steady output of X amount over the next hour.""

Non-helix type, [Lenz2](http://www.windstuffnow.com/main/vawt.htm) is a well-designed model, (I've build a few myself), that uses 'lift' as well.   
It's even tested in a windtunnel, the high-spec HAWT's gets upto 50%, this one around 40-45%. (and the typical savonius around 20-25% ?)

36,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;VAWTS are a better design.   

Personal taste might drown brain-activity.    

HAWT-blades are always running at at the ~~right~~ correct angle to the wind, VAWT's always have a surface going into the wind, making it unlikely they will ever be as efficient.   

Having said that, **not** having your generator and stuff on top of the mast, but at ground-level, makes maintenance a lot easier, and getting rid of the 'into the wind' mechanical stuff is a nice extra.   

As OP is ""looking into building"", for 1st time experimenters, VAWT's are much more forgiving than the rather critical wing-shape needed for HAWT's.

37,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Uh... some confusion, I think.  
HAWT blades at the ~~right~~ correct angle to the wind, compare with airplane wings, there is *always* a functional airflow, producing power.   

&gt; which requires additional gearing.   

The VAWT-axis is vertical, which you can extend to ground level, connect to a 'vertical' axis generator, and no gearbox is needed (technically).  
The VAWT-rpm is low, if you have a highspeed generator you do need one.

tl;dr: if you speed up the wind, you lower the density.  
    
[Betz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27_law) is another guy with some strong opinion on this.        
tl;dr: energy depends on density.   
   
That double-trumpet-like contraption in the 2nd picture is supposed to act as a venturi, but with all the open space around it (with lower air-resistance), well, that's where the wind is going.   
  
The 3rd picture makes more sense (airflow-wise), but the 2 90⁰ bends cause a lot of friction, lowering airspeed,   
and for the energy-calculation: P=0.5 x density x area x windspeed³,    
you still have to use outside windspeed and that large trumpet-area.   
(However, it is possible you get some extra vacuum inside).   
 
The HAWT-part is a proper venturi, but with higher windspeed, the only thing they manage to do is shrinking the turbine proper.   
That, of course, gives them bragging rights:  
3 times as much energy compared to a similar blade-sized turbine.   

Edit: just looked at the 9th picture.   
With all that unrestricted airspace available, why would the wind voluntairily make a 90⁰ bend down, and try to escape through a tiny hole at the other end?

* Make 100% sure you understand the difference between MW and MWh, especially in a finance role. You misused them in your post and interviewers will treat this as a dead giveaway that you have a loose grasp on power/energy. MW is an instantaneous measurement of real time power. MWh is energy that you buy and sell (power over a period of time - in this case, an hour.) 
* If you have 100 5.0MW turbines, your theoretical peak plant output is 100 * 5 = 500MW. If you generated at your peak output for 24 hours straight, you would have just generated 500MW*24h = 12,000MWh in that day. Energy is what you sell so this is almost always what finance cares about. 
* If your plant has a capacity factor of 30% that means your plant is predicted to generate 30% of its theoretical max over the course of one year. There are 8,760 hours in one year. So your 500MW plant is projected to generate 500MW * 8760 * 30% = 1,314,000 MWh in a year. Reread this as many times as you need to so you're sure it makes sense. 
* If you can sell that power at $100/MWh all year long, your total **gross** projected yearly revenue (@ 30% capacity factor) is 1,314,000MWh * $100/MWh = $131,400,000.

The wind lens definitely works--it'll even allow you to exceed the betz limit.  But you have to build your tower much stronger.  Which involves a lot more material, because generally speaking not only do you have to build it stronger, you now have to build it stiffer as well.  There are two types of tower: soft, where the resonant frequency is below that of the blade-passing frequency, and hard where it is above.  Most turbines these days are soft.

You might want to look into that claim a bit more. First of all, it's important to consider that this is highly location-specific. Wind turbines *do* kill some birds and bats, however they don't kill nearly as much as many would have you believe. Buildings kill orders-of-magnitude more birds, for instance. I'm looking for a peer-reviewed assessment I had of bird deaths due to turbines but I can't find it at the moment. If you look (for reputable sources) you'll find that the media tends to sensationalize bird deaths. One thing is certain: a huge amount of wildlife does *not* die from hitting wind turbine rotors. *Some* birds and bats are killed, and in *some* areas wind turbine siting needs to be carefully considered due to specific local bird populations, but generally wind turbines are not the bird murdering machines some people would like everyone to believe. 



&gt;But is it possible to encase the turbine in a grill like we have attached to our home pedestal fans?

That would be entirely impractical. It would significantly reduce the air flow through the turbine, at great physical cost, for essentially no benefit. It's not as easy as building a cage around the turbine's rotor. This cage would either have to be a gigantic cage--almost like putting a big dome over the entire turbine--so that the turbine could rotate freely inside, or it would have to be a cage surrounding the 100m+ diameter rotor, mounted to the nacelle so that it always surrounds the rotating blade. Both of these options are hugely expensive, and the structural issues in the second nacelle-mounted cage seem pretty mind-boggling. 

You'd also have to keep the mesh of the cage relatively fine if you want to keep out small birds and bats. The finer the mesh, the worse the air flow through the turbine. 

&gt;I'm sure there could be an easy solution to keep all the birds safe.

57,DGS83,wind,t5_2qyr2,"With early designs of wind turbines in the 70’s and 80’s there was indeed a problem with avian mortality, with a avian mortality rate of 20 per turbine a year, this was due to two reasons, firstly the design of the turbine towers, the use of a lattice frame encouraged birds to perch or even nest on the turbines, this has been rectified with the use of tube towers and designing the nacelles with no surfaces which can be used for nesting or perching, this has ceased to be a problem since the early 90’s. The second issue was due to the swept area of the turbine blades, the smaller turbines of the 70’s and 80’s having a much decreased swept area they needed a higher RPM to generate efficiently, as turbines have got larger and the swept area of the blades has increased the easier it is for birds to avoid the blades. Currently the average mortality rate per turbine is 1-2 a year, with some sights recording less than one a year per turbine a year. As the next generation of turbines are about to come onto the market, with the Siemens D6 6MW platform and the Vestas 8Mw platform looking like being the market leaders being designed for instillation up to 70km offshore the risk of avian mortality is reduced even more.

Up close, they *are* noisy and have irritating shadows.       
The problem in the US, there is no law that prohibits construction close to (other peoples) residences, and if you show up somewhere as a wind-worker, people *will* complain to you about that.        

Familiar yourself with dB's, sound propagation and attenuation-over-distance, the sun's angular diameter is ~0.5⁰, the biggest blade (sofar) is ~6m wide, calculate the minimum distance where you don't have shadow problems.

I actually don't mind the noise of the wind turbines in motion, but the noise in the nacelle is awful. And, the noise that is made when you make an emergency stop of the blades is really, really weird. However, I couldn't really hear the turbines from a distance.

They accidentally did that a year ago, and the brakes were too good, 'things' broke, and the nacelle and blades needed replacement.     

&gt;I think people can live with the turbines even if they complain about the noise.       

The locals nearby have to live/sleep in that shadow/noise 24/7/365.     
It's better to be an 'understanding' company that (sort of) refuses to build a turbine that's too close to a residence, and of course you give them all the scientific data on 'why' you think it is a bad idea.        
If those residents like the money too much, and *ask* you to build a turbine there (despite all the warnings), hey.. that's a completely different ball-game (but do offer a smaller-shadow/less-noisy model as an option).       
 
Mouth-to-mouth advertising can be very powerful, even residents where you 'refuse' to build a turbine, will talk to their neighbours about it, (most likely using words like 'honest' and 'not being shafted').    
Remember, you are in it for the long run, maintenance twice a year (nice to be invited for tea and cookies), and turbine replacement after 25 years. (and possibly an invitation out-of-the-blue from an interested neighbour.)    

Setting up 'demo' fields (organized on-request/monthly by a local farmer?), where locals can walk up close to a turbine and experience shadow/noise themselves (and compare to the documents you obviously gave them), is probably the best 'debunking that FUD' method you can use, and, important, it leaves the initiative with the locals.

I just find it interesting that different governments / councils interpret the impacts differently.

79,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;that different governments / councils interpret the impacts differently.

Depends on worldwide location:      
Higher latitudes have lower sun altitude, therefore more shadow area, as do turbines on top of a hill, which could also extend the noise distance.        

Getting ahead of the 'planning-permission' game i.s.o. playing catch-up:     
Turbines are getting bigger, Enercon already has blades that are ~6m wide at the base, and the 'low windspeed' blades in development are probably wider as well, extending shadow distance.       
Having set a 'longer distance' means it won't change in the next 20 years, which is nice for long term planning.       

'Interpretation' depends heavily on 'donations' as well, I guess.      
Where I live, lots of farmers were willing to build a windturbine on their fields, but controlfreak-council decided single turbines are ugly, and they must be build ""in line, 10 minimum"", leaving only the big utilities who could afford that (who promptly applied for permits, of course).        
Rather unexpectedly, when faced with all the con's and non of the pro's, all farmers suddenly lost interest, and council/government had no option but to approve windpark ownership by local co-op's, with the utilities just being minor shareholders.      
(Non-farming locals could buy shares as well, as compensation for the 'horizon pollution', greatly reducing the amount of 'objections').

80,mathew51b,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Obviously I am just saying how things are in the UK and trying to understand how the industry operates elsewhere. 

I didn't mean that distances are set. In the UK, we have to assess shadow flicker within 10 rotor diameters of the turbine, as outside of this area shadows dissipate sufficiently (I'm not saying it doesn't exist). For example, the UK is currently focussing on 90m rotor diameter turbines, so we have to assess all shadow flicker within 900m of the project. If the blades are wider, the profile of the shadow changes and that is all taken into consideration. If shadow flicker occurs over a certain amount a year (generally accepts as around 30 hours a year), then we mitigate by turning off the troublesome turbine during the time when shadow flicker could occur. Latitude is taken into consideration for these calculations too.

Its similar for noise, as we use a sound propagation model in the UK, that to everyones understanding, is the best available. Again, we don't just say ""all houses must be 400m from a turbine"", only to build the loudest turbine available. We have to comply with a noise level at the nearest dwelling, and if we exceed this we will be shut down. This has recently happened to a scheme in Scotland. Obviously, louder turbines have a much larger distance required, all of which needs to be modelled pre planning / permitting.

Your mention of community style projects is ideal - I have worked for community groups trying to make this happen, where locals could invest in the project. There are a number of schemes and methods for people to invest in schemes in the UK now through places like Abundance, Energy4All and other more localised projects.

Fair enough that the finances didn't work for the farmers to come together in a co-op. 

In-line (or linear) designs of wind farms are discouraged here and considered to be poorly designed as from certain views the project can look strange - interesting that again, different places favour different styles.

If you don't feel like reading the whole article though, in summary it seems to be mostly to reduce the overall weight of the machine by removing a superfluous blade. Also noise reduction isn't as important offshore as on. Seems like the argument comes down to something like ""why order three blades per turbine if we can do just as well with two?"" Even if it doesn't save much money for the overall wind project, it's one less piece that needs to be transported offshore. 

Why three blades are popular, particularly onshore, has to do with the wind speeds required to achieve peak efficiency. Two blade machines need to rotate faster. More importantly the slower yawing operations of a three-blader puts less strain on the overall machine.

This is the single most important thing in wind energy. As soon as it is competitive with fossil power, it does not need government subsidies. The governments are currently driving the market unfortunately, but it shouldn't take too long. I believe every decade wind energy has dropped 20% in price! As a result up to 2030 200,000 jobs are added in Europe in the wind energy.

Pro: very little CO2 production of course, no energy dependency, low pollution (though some in China :( ). It is the cheapest renewable energy source, apart from hydro and thermal. It is a really secure investment, you know that for 20+ years that turbine will generate power 97+% of the time. Most materials are recyclable or reusable.

Con: it is still more expensive than fossil energy sources. Some people don't like the view or the noise. Offshore should handle that.

It is also not particularly relevent to wind farm operators. Lower fidelity computations and even simple empirical wake models are probably good enough to predict power production to the degree of certainty that they require. For these reasons, I don't ever see SOWFA integrated into a wind turbine/farm control algorithm. That's not to say that SOWFA doesn't have its uses. I think it is incredibly useful in wind turbine design. Typically, wind turbines are designed for uniform wind conditions. We know that the atmosphere is actually very turbulent. SOWFA can be used to analyze wind turbine loading in a more realistic atmosphere. It can also be used to improve wake models. As of yet, most empirical wake models are based off a limited number of field and lab experiments. SOWFA provides the flexibility to tailor these models based on atmospheric conditions like wind speed, atmospheric stability and turbulence intensity. My particular research uses SOWFA to analyze the wake of a dual rotor turbine. We want to see if it will cause enhanced mixing of the wake compared to a traditional single rotor wind turbine. If it does, then the wake would theoretically replenish itself faster leading to a decrease in wind farm wake loss. ",1412192865.0

Two forces act on the rotor, thrust and torque. Thrust is the force in the direction of the wind and torque causes the blades and generator to spin. Thrust is necessary and unavoidable but an adverse load as it bends the blade and turbine. Thrust is several factors larger than torque usually. (Physically it is a desired force as well, but mechanically it is not. But this is a different topic.)

Torque is the desired force. It spins the turbine. Torque times rotational speed equals the generated power. A balance between rotational speed and torque must be sought. Low torque high speed is beneficial for the drivetrain as generators function at high speed. However, the speed is limited by the speed of the tip because of noise.

So, if you want more power output: increase torque or speed, of which the latter is limited because of noise. More torque also results in more thrust and loads on blades and turbine.",1413191076.0

I'm not sure if the increased performance is in line with that of multistage gas turbines. To be honest, I don't enough about them to give you a good answer.

There are legitimate concerns about increased  fatigue loading with the addition of a second rotor. Anytime you add a moving component to a machine, you are likely to have issues. Right now, we are performing an aeromechanical analysis using FAST. We want to see how the turbulence generated from the secondary rotor will effect the fatigue loading on the primary rotor. It is still early to draw conclusions, but it looks like there really isn't that much of a difference between a conventional HAWT and our DRWT.

There is no doubt that a shroud would increase the efficiency even more. It would just be incredibly hard to manufacture on such a large scale. I could definitely see smaller DRWTs with shrouds in the future though.

&gt;

&gt;The *Windbelt* is a device for converting [wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power) to electricity.  A __windbelt__ is essentially an [aeolian harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_harp) except that it exploits the motion of the string produced by [the aeroelastic flutter effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter) to move a [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet) closer and farther from one or more [coils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_coil) and thus induce current in the wires that make up the coil.

&gt;Prototypes of the device are claimed to be 10 - 30 times more efficient than [small wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_wind_turbine). One prototype has powered two LEDs, a radio, and a clock (separately) using wind generated from a household fan.  The cost of the materials was well under US$10.  $2–$5 for 40 mW is a cost of $50–$125 per watt. In reality 40 mW from a 50% efficient 25w fan gives 0.32% efficiency.

&gt;There are three sizes in development:

&gt;


&gt;* The microBelt, a 12 cm version. This could be put into production in around six months. Its expected to produce 1 milliwatt average.  To charge a pair of ideal rechargeable AA cells (2.5Ah 1.2v) this would take 6000 hours, or 250 days.

&gt;* The Windcell, a 1 metre version that could be used to power meshed WiFi repeaters, charge cellphones, or run LED lights. This could go into production within 18 to 24 months. It is hoped that a square metre panel at 6 m/s average windspeed can generate 10 W average. 

&gt;* an experimental 10-metre model that has no production date.    

&gt;The Windbelt's inventor, Shawn Frayne, was a winner of the 2007 Breakthrough Award from the publishers of the magazine, *[Popular Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mechanics)*.  He is trying to make the Windbelt cheaper.

Offshore is having issues currently with people saying it harms the view, something people pay big money to live near. It seems like the amount of people living near the coastal projects is higher than some of the rural onshore projects.

In the end it all boils down to the PTC (production tax credits). The PTC pays a wind generator 23$ a megawatt hour, over what the market price is.

TLDR wind energy development is EXTREMELY site specific and without details this is a shot in the dark and a general/typical scenario answer based on my knowledge of US based wind energy dev. I will gladly answer your detailed questions through PM if you'd like more answers. The odds are, your best option is to reach out to a developer and have them do all of the work and own the machines. They will pay you rent similar to you having an oil well on your property. Wind turbines are expensive and risky to own if you are not a professional. 

The first question that needs to be answered is, where are the closest utility lines and what their capacity is. If you are on a single phase line (your utility line at the top of the pole is only one wire not three as you see in more developed areas) and there is not three phase within a few miles then your process of elimination may be over because the cost of your utility upgrades will likely outweigh the benefits of the wind turbines you/a developer plan on putting on your land. With bigger farms this can be overlooked because you can justify spending ~$500k per mile of three phase run to your site by investing in a large amount of turbines. You really need to lower the utility upgrade cost/turbine as much as possible because without subsidies or high local power costs the project is most likely already working on pretty tight margins (this is important later when you will look for project financing). Without seeing a map of your land I am going to assume that you will not be able to place more than three 2MW machines on 15 hectares (~37 acres). In this situation you should put the BIGGEST MACHINES POSSIBLE. Gamesa is making 3-5MW turbines now that seem to be where the industry is going, though I don't know how well they're performing outside of lab tests yet based on my personal experiences. We can get into more detailed utility based questions later but for now start here and understand that you will probably be spending more than a million dollars on utility interconnection and line upgrades. General rule of thumb is to assume $4 million per (well-sited) 2MW machine when building them in a farm the size of yours. 

Next question is, what is your average annual wind speed? You need your weibull factor, air density, direction, altitude, avg temp, and terrain qualities in the area. Again, wind energy dev is extremely site specific. You can get most, if not all of this for free if you look in the right places and your region is well documented. Talk to a professional or a turbine supplier and they will likely steer you in the right direction. Or PM me and we can work through this together. 


Let's assume your site checks out and you get this thing permitted and the utility will allow you to connect it to the grid. Now you have to sell the power somewhere. If there is net metering available, great, you're about to make a TON of money. If not, that's fine you can sell it wholesale and will likely make an investable return that will be worth your energy. Selling power is a job on it's own and unless you're well connected with executives in a few local industrial companies I'd suggest finding a broker. This is their job after all and they're professionals. You are not. 

Once you have a power purchase agreement in place (PPA) to sell your power you can get financing. Plan on having 30% of the total costs for a down payment and finance as much as possible with bank debt whereas it's the cheapest money you'll find. Or get it bonded if you can, though that usually requires a larger project than the one you can put on your land. Financing is tricky, so find a professional and work through this with them. 

It is a lot of work to own wind turbines. You will not be able to work on them yourself and will have to hire someone. These are MASSIVE generators that require constant attention. Fortunately they can be remotely monitored and if you work with a company like GE you can minimize all headaches. Seriously though, if you're investing in a few turbines and you want to own them, hire a professional and let them handle the maintenance.  Maybe in 5-10 years if you really pay attention you can start doing some of the work yourself. 

As far as your return goes, expect something greater than 12% and up to 30% (IRR) depending on your site and how well you're able to structure the PPA. Again, it's site specific and with more details I could give you an accurate answer. Like I said earlier, if you're putting up 2MW machines expect them to cost about $4million each all in. But this can be variable.

160,ayankeeintexas,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Ok, so this is a start! The fact that those lines are there and relatively close is a good sign (that appears to be three-phase from your street view though it's a different orientation than I am used to seeing in the US). Odds are you will have to upgrade the lines to a higher voltage if you go with larger machines. This prediction is based on how rural that area appears. 

The next question to have answered, and this is a question that you will need to have answered by your electrical utility company, is how much distributed generation is currently connected on your circuit (connected to the substation your lines are going to/coming from). If you don't have a lot of wind turbines or solar near your property the odds are your lines are clear of congestion. Wind power is an EXTREMELY volatile and spiky energy source that can reek havoc on grid reliability if proper shock absorbers are not in place. Again the odds are you'll be fine in this situation, but keep in mind that without an adequate storage source acting as a shock absorber grids cannot have too much wind generation connected to them. 

I looked at the wind data and honestly won't be able to correlate that to a projected speed at the hub of a typical turbine you would be installing until tomorrow morning. It's midnight here on the east coast. Seems like your working with about 2.5 m/s on the ground though, so let's hope that is blowing at 6+ on average at ~80 meters or this won't be a good site. 

I'll get back to you with a little bit more info later. Let's hope your site is suitable for wind power. The more turbines sold the better off we all are! 

[edit: at 80 meters with the weather info you provided you're looking at roughly a 7.5m/s wind speed. At 100 meters you're up around 7.8m/s. These are predicted values and should be treated as such. I used a wind shear exponent of 0.14, if anyone thinks I was wrong in assuming that please advise. Just a note, those wind speeds make this worthy of pursuing.

Glad to hear you're interested in study wind energy resource assessment. I understand the struggle you are having getting a hold of wind resource data; wind developers are businesses that need to protect their property and information. You're smart to be contacting other universities (especially DTU, they're pretty much #1 in wind energy research), because they tend to be much more willing to share their data. I say that because I too work with a university studying wind energy.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to any LiDAR data, so I can't help you there. I do have a number of meteorological tower data sets and some SODAR data though, if you're interested. I work at the Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA. We have 2 SODAR units and have installed over 40 meteorological towers across Virginia over the past decade. You say you're studying in Sweden, so I imagine you want your project to have a European focus, but if you're interested in working with some US based data, I can help you out.

One thing I've always thought would be interesting, but I haven't had time to do myself, would be a wind speed map validation project. Here in the US, we use wind speed prediction models made by AWS Truepower to do a preliminary assessment. I always thought it would be interesting to compare the data from our 40+ towers to their models, figure out why/how they differ, and figure out ways to improve their accuracy. Just an idea I thought I'd throw out there.

Send me an email if you'd be interested in any of the data we have, or if you want to talk about project ideas. We never have a shortage of ideas! Our email is: vacenter4windenergy@jmu.edu

Two distinct causes, the first is the 'whine' of the gearbox, that will become noticeable after a few years when it gets worn a bit, modern 'direct-drive' turbines do not have this problem.     
The second is the 'whoosh-whoosh' sound that occurs when a blade in the 'low' position passes close to the tower, creating this big pressure differential.      
Sound is energy, modern designs reduce this noise to increase efficiency a bit.      
If you can find out what type of turbine they are planning to build, and at what locations they are already working, you can google-fu the local newspapers for comments.      

Some jurisdictions base the distance on dB-measurements *indoors* and have the turbine owner pay for sound insulation if it is too much, you are better of with low dB's in your backyard.

192,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"A bit late, but I stumbled upon your comment.

The problem is that the root faces far lower wind velocity than the tip. Hence it needs a large chord and large twist. This low velocity also results in relatively low torque generated by the root part.

On top of that, the root is obviously the heaviest loaded part. So you usually don't want large twist and difficult geometries at the root. Especially because the laminate can be 10-20 cm thick at the root. You just can't create a difficult shape. At least, not in the wind industry, where a blade can only cost ~10$/kg.

So, having an airfoil kind of shape will result in large additional expenses. It's a trade-off between the relatively low increase in performance and the large increased difficulty in manufacturing.

Enercon circumvents this by creating a metal root part. You can't really see it in the pictures, but the larger Enercon blades actually start after ~10% of the blade. The first part is some kind of extender with the chord. I can assure you that this is more expensive than a normal blade. Apparently the gains weigh up against the additional expenses.

Point is though, you can't just turn the root into an airfoil shape.",1426793306.0

I have worked on 2 types of turbines, one that the gearbox attached directly to the rotor and the other where a main shaft is used to connect the gearbox to the rotor. Both have their pro's and cons... The direct drive gearbox was MASSIVE compared to a ""conventional"" turbine gearbox, but the nacelle could be made a lot smaller due to not having a mainshaft. The gearbox will speed up the rotation by around 100 RPM (depending on the turbine type this varies). They deal with the constant variations through other electrical components in the converter system, can't go into too much detail here for confidentiality reasons, but they have a certain amount of slip they can induce or retard if need be.

Aside from the fact that there is a fair amount of rubber and plastic parts, just like there is in your cars engine, turbines also require a ton of lube and grease for general maintenance. 

In a perfect world I'm sure you could orchestrate this, but sourcing every nut and bolt from a facility that used no fossil fuels in the process of making that part would be almost impossible.

219,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Hey man, just seen this thread. Have you still been giving this concept some thought? I'm a big wind energy guy and got interested in this exact same topic over the past week, and lemme tell ya, the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep. Also, everyone in this thread is assuming you are talking about a turbine that doesn't have a gearbox, but it sounds like you are asking if there is a wind turbine that has a continuously variable transmission, right?",1436928899.0
220,Vailhem,wind,t5_2qyr2,x-post: /r/EnergyStorage,1436986539.0
221,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt; So something I learned (I'm not big on electrical engineering) is that if you have a 50Hz output, that's 1500 rpm with a two pole generator (50*60/2) or 1000 rpm with a three pole etc. You still need to get from your, say 25 rpm, to that speed though and you have the issue that the 25 rpm isn't constant so you may need to go from 1-35rpm say, but still maintain your 50Hz output. 

Yep! This is exactly how I stumbled onto the idea of a CVT in a turbine. Also, the main purpose of a CVT to me is to synchronize power output of the turbine to the grid, without that the CVT doesn't matter. In my opinion, this would require some very sophisticated electronic controlling, but in big fossil fired plants they are able to do this with a steam input, so why couldn't it be achieved with wind?

&gt; I believe you can also skip the mechanical gearbox and have a direct drive to the generator but have a variable frequency generator. This uses power electronics to modify the output frequency - as mad-jabroni alludes to. 

Is this possible without rectifying the AC to DV and then inverting back to AC? Because that's exactly what all modern wind turbines do. The problem is the power loss in conversion. If it *is* possible without that conversion, then there is no point to the CVT.

Anyways, I've been working on a couple of different designs over this past week. The biggest problem with a CVT is the theoretical slippage, and unless there is an incredibly low amount of slippage, the benefits of having the CVT don't overcome the inefficiencies it creates when compared to modern turbine designs with a discrete gear ratio.

A turbine fitted with a very well performing CVT could theoretically be directly grid tied and synchronized. I believe some earlier turbine designs did this but the design was so inefficient it lost to modern designs that took advantage of high wind speeds (higher voltage by turning generator faster, which produced tangibly more power after the AC-DC-AC conversion).

My basic design has been completed, but what I am currently working on is trying to take advantage of high wind speeds by engaging additional generators using the high torque when you have that much wind. It seems to me that, unless you do this, the CVT really doesn't matter. The CVT won't have the AC-DC-AC conversion losses like 99% of current turbines, nor would it require that equipment, but that's really its only advantage if you can't take generate additional amperage past the point where you run out of gearing and you have to start pitching the blades or applying the brakes on the main shaft.

Are you in the renewable energy field?",1437096199.0
222,greedos_speedos,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Ok I guess with a fossil fired plant you've got a relatively stable, fixed load and speed though. 

I think the AC-DC-AC thing is dependent on the type of generator you use - I'm not entirely sure (as I say this isn't my strong point) I do have some notes on this somewhere that I have to go back and read. 

When you say 'CVT' and you talk about slippage - what type of CVT are you talking about? Because there are many varieties. 

I'm an engineer - although not in renewable energy - it's what interests me the most and I did a course on Wind Energy at University - hence my (half) knowledge. ",1437158463.0
223,grandma_alice,wind,t5_2qyr2,"One minor correction - Iowa is second in wind energy production, not California.  California is second in the amount of wind capacity, but Iowa is a close third, for now",1437163764.0
224,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt; I think the AC-DC-AC thing is dependent on the type of generator you use

As far as I know, any unsynchronized wind turbine must go through this process, because there is no type of generator/alternator that I am aware of that outputs DC voltage without it first being rectified. This isn't really that import for our sake, because the whole purpose of a CVT is to not have to rectify or invert anything; it's to output synchronized AC power.

&gt; When you say 'CVT' and you talk about slippage - what type of CVT are you talking about? Because there are many varieties.

The reason energy losses through slippage and energy losses through friction are such a big deal with CVTs is because the design must necessarily create them, unlike other types of transmissions where you can actually mesh gears and unlike the gearboxes of modern wind turbines that (as I said before) have only one gear ratio.

In nearly every CVT design, you have some main ""pulley"" or smooth ""gear"" that has to effectively change diameter, which means you cannot use a chain drive or sprockets without the setup eventually having to skip some teeth; which as you know isn't a good thing. This is why engineers use rubber belts for these (See a moped or scooter CVT), and as you already know, rubber results in quite a bit of frictional losses.

My personal favorite design is the cone style CVT (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission#/media/File:Evans_friction_cone_-_Hagley_Aug_2009.jpg). This principle of using cones in the design of a CVT necessitates slippage. See the leather ring in the picture? The wider the ""ring"" between the cones is, the greater the slippage on the edges of the ring at the contact point because the edges are trying to rotate at a slightly different speed than the middle of the ring. However, this can be overcome by using a ring with an infinitely small contact point between the cones. For a couple of days I mentally wrestled with the concept of a geared cone, until I realized that you cannot gear a cone from top to bottom and maintain the same tooth width, spacing, and pitch; so the cone can only be smooth. The cone style CVT is what my wind turbine CVT design is based upon.

237,ShaGZ81,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Exactly. Basically, you would need to make sure that the air still can escape as intended from the building.

239,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Once you find the wind speed, post it here. The amount of power available is:

Power in Watts = 0.5 x Air Density x Rotor Swept Area x Windspeed^2

And then the Betz Limit mandates that you can only capture 59% of that amount of energy with a perfectly efficient turbine design. However, industrial turbines only reach up to about 75% of the Betz Limit, with residential turbines achieving FAR lower efficiencies.

My guess is turbines at each vent would make enough power to turn on a light bulb or something.

Also, your drawing indicates that your turbine would be up against your building. This would drastically reduce the amount of power you can capture. You need to have as much open space as possible behind the turbine for the wind to blow through it and then expand. If they are mounted like that, the above formula wouldn't even be accurate anymore as it is tailored to an open space.

However, if the wind speed were high enough, maybe there's the possibility they could produce a meaningful amount of power. The turbines would be best suited to be installed directly onto the vents though.

262,Rocksteady2R,wind,t5_2qyr2,"well, at a very basic level, ""yes"" is the correct answer to whether there is a reduction in the ""wind"" itself.

There is a scientific law, and someone else may correct/modify my understanding of it, but this law is called ""[the conservation of energy](https://www.google.com/#q=conservation+of+energy)"".   In short, a system of energy always has a given amount of energy.  

an example would be a pot of boiling water.  you start with X amount of water.  you apply Y amount of heat.  between the heat radiated outward, the steam created and the water boiled, you *still* only ever have as much energy as you started with.

So yes, the fact that there is a blade obstructing the wind-pattern does in fact have an effect on the backside of that turbine, but the energy is simply diverted into making the turbine spin.  I've taken a few classes on turbines, installed a few, but never have I done ""behind the turbine"" calculations for what happens to the oncoming wind.  It is, as far as I know, considered inconsequential unless, perhaps (perhaps!), if you are doing an intensive wind farm where you have a high concentration of turbines in a given ""range"" of each other.

So as not to affect each other, turbines are placed ~5 times the rotor diameter apart from each other, if the rotor diameter is 100m, the distance between them is 500m.     
Put a [single line](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/GreenMountainWindFarm_Fluvanna_2004.jpg) of turbines inside that weather system (radius is 500km), we have room for 1000 turbines.

As you can see, there is a large range: from US$1700/kW to US$2150/kW. Generally speaking, the larger projects will be cheaper per kW of installed capacity due to economy of scale. In terms of operational expenditure, it's in the order of US$10/MWhr of generation. Note the difference in units between capital and operational expenditure.

So looking at an example, let's use a 50 MW wind farm. Using $2000/kW, that comes to US$100 million for capital cost. 

Most wind farms will have a capacity factor of approximately [35%](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/households/WindEnergyfactsheet.pdf). This means our 50 MW wind farm will produce ~150 GWhr/yr. So the operational expenditure will be approximately US$1.5 million per year.

272,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"You're asking a really broad question.

First of all, the government doesn't build the turbines. Energy companies do, and the government supports them to bridge the gap between the market and the more expensive wind. So, with 4 billion the government can only support the construction.

If you want to know how much turbines one can build with 4 billion, that depends. Offshore? Onshore? High/low wind class? Offshore is more expensive, and building turbines in areas where there isn't much wind, you'll get expensive energy. Point is, every site is different and has different costs and different electricity generation.

If you want to compare energy sources, you may want to look into Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). This is a convenient way of comparing different energy sources. It calculates all costs per generated unit of energy: $/MWh. How many households, or how many turbines are often useless to compare different sources.

Now to your actual question: I'll do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. It costs roughly USD 2 million per MW installed capacity in Europe (onshore). So your £4bn (USD 6.14 bn) buys you ~3GW of turbines. That's 600-1500 turbines, depending on the size of the turbine (2MW-5MW). Offshore is twice as expensive, so you could only buy 1.5GW and 300-750 turbines.

If we continue with the 3GW of onshore capacity, with a capacity factor of 35%, this capacity will net you 10 TWh per year. The 1.5GW offshore will net 6.6 TWh per year if a 50% capacity factor is assumed.

A British household consumes about 4700 kWh *electricity* per year. So you could power more than 2 million households with your 3GW onshore capacity.

Finally, maintenance: 3GW onshore will cost roughly USD 13 million per year. If we take the 0.013 USD/kWh. The 1.5 GW offshore will cost ~USD 17 million per year.

This 200m donut is anchored to the sea floor, when a freak 50m wave hits, the (vertical) flexing between the anchor points is probably considerable (not to mention the lifting force on the anchors, if that moves and looses the pre-tension: bye-bye experiment), and the donut could become an oval (articulated bearings like a train-set?).    
You could make a flexible donut (like an inner tube in the swimming pool), but that could create some problems with the 200m diameter bearings (proposed maglev, that works with 2-5mm distance), the variable torque of a 100m high(wind) or deep(water) wing/sail on a fairly narrow base is considerable (flowing water will push a car sideways when it is higher than the wheel axles).    

Added complications: salt water *will* splash on top of it, the water evaporates, leaving a salt crust the bearings(protection) has to deal with, and crustaceans *will* collect everywhere below the water line.    

Electrical generation is maybe not the smartest thing, compressed air (as proposed) seems better, but a small leak will leave it useless, with hydraulics (potable water) a small leak only reduces the efficiency.

310,The-Mech-Guy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Really good feedback, thanks.  I like the idea of continuous power output if placed in the gulf stream.  Are there other 24/7 alternative energies out there without using storage?  Maybe geothermal?  Plus they don't need to be rigidly embedded into the ocean floor like existing wind turbines; deeper water installations mean less local issues with ""visual pollution"" etc.

While large (all) ships flex in heavier seas, they are still rigid enough to not snap in half when only supported in the middle, or not supported in the middle.  The flex is planned but limited.  Is there any chance this donut could be made rigid enough to allow the bearings to work?  This donut is 200m in diameter, the longest ship right now is 458m long.

50m wave??  Did you mean 50ft?  After a quick search the largest (rouge) wave ever recorded was 84 feet high during 20ft high seas.  This could pose a serious threat to the 'experiment'.  There is a line on the design benefits page that says - ""submersible in catastrophic conditions: survival mode"".  If a tsunami wave is headed towards it, like the 50ft high one recently in India, with enough warning maybe it could duck under the wave.

I agree that the loads on the base / carriage will be very high.  Another line on the design benefits page says - ""retractable and/or tilting airfoils adapt to ..."".  Downside is more moving parts/complexity, but it looks like the 3 bladed version is in three retractable segments with a pivot at the top.  If true this would reduce the moment on the base significantly.  I believe the gulf stream ocean current flow is fairly consistent year round.  So the underwater current blades could be shaped / tuned to each installation location = not retractable.  The crustacean problem is real and would need to be addressed.  It would probably need to be regularly cleaned like all man-made things that sit in salt water.  I own a boat that sits in briny water and need to hire a diver to clean the bottom and check/replace the sacrificial zinc anodes 2-3 times a year.",1453914974.0
311,The-Mech-Guy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Thanks for commenting.  With all due respect, offshore oil platforms in operation for decades have 1000+ more moving parts on them than this device.  I doubt you're saying that every moving part on offshore oil platforms needs to be replaced every couple months.  I think we can agree that this idea is still in the concept stage and years of serious engineering work remain before anything would be built.  It would take a multi-national corp. or multi-billionaire to fund this ... I'm just a working man.

Many conventional HAWT wind turbines have main bearing issues, offshore or not.  The variable and pulsed loads on the main cantilevered bearing are large enough to wear them out, necessitating costly repairs and lengthy service interruptions.  Count how many wind turbines are NOT working in the huge array on I-10 east of LA at any given moment.  To be honest I don't know if all or most of those are main bearing issues.

So the mag-lev concept notwithstanding, why wouldn't train tracks work at least for the upper wind ring?  Super low rolling resistance, very heavy load capacity, and trains already operate very near or even over salt water (long bridges over oceans /seas).  Maybe this device would see harsher conditions than trains currently see, but train tracks/wheels/bearings seem very robust - they've got 'em figured out.  And yes this round track would need an inner and outer, AND an upper and lower track, or at least two sets of wheels on one inner and outer track in order to manage the over turning moment from the large wind blades.  Just add enough wheels to distribute the forces along a section of the track under each 'wing'.  Then there is no single point of failure like current HAWT's.

The underwater bearing solution is much tougher though.  And that's a huge benefit to be able to claim alternative energy production 24/7.  Serious engineering work remains, indeed.

As you mentioned, geothermal and the gulf stream are probably the only ones, the rest suffers from intermittency in one way or the other.      

If the whole system can be be made rigid enough to survive some really bad weather you need to ask a mechanical/maritime engineer, but after reading several articles ""Promising new technology will be tested at sea"", followed shortly after by pictures of a scrap yard on the beach, I'm a bit sceptical if that 'all-in-one with many moving parts' will work/survive.

The ocean is not only powerful but relentless as well.  It's one of the apparent benefits - If something like this could be built to survive, it would be surrounded be limitless energy.  You're 'scrap yard on the beach'  seems historically to be true.  To that point, I'm watching the new Fukushima FLOATING wind turbine carefully.  With the current bearing issues for HAWT's I'm having a difficult time imagining how to either keep the top nacelle from moving, or to manage the additional forces at the main bearing from allowing it move.

I also prefer the KIS principal (a little less insulting, and not Keep It Stupid lol) so with that in mind, is there a simpler way to extract wind, wave, and ocean current in deep water?  Or your point is that maybe it's just too tough of a problem/environment?  Just curious, thanks.",1453929098.0

2) Pretty much any turbine you see stopped is going to be due to low wind speed. I am a wind turbine engineer. I can't vouch for the site near LA, but our sites operate around 99% availability. Availability is a measurement of when our turbines are ""available"" to run if the wind is at the right speed. That 1% of downtime is mainly due to service technicians uptower or main components being replaced. These turbines are supposed to last 20 years. However, the parts that make up that hole will not all last 20 years. There is a very good chance that a blade, main bearing, gearbox, or generator will need to be replaced at some point over the turbine's lifetime.

3) Train wheels are pretty much just a form of roller bearings, not too far removed from what are used in current wind turbine bearing. Same concept, metal on metal lubricated contact results in very low rolling friction. They also mention using air/water bearings. I don't know much about air bearings, just that they need precision machining. For a 200m bearing.

At MAX power this concept would theoretically make as much power as four offshore wind turbines. This thing calls for a 200m bearing of permanent magnets. Just that alone would likely be more expensive than those four wind turbines.

Solar panels are also a nice 'business plan' philosophical discussion.    
The panels are expected to degrade to 80% production after 30 years (worst case), the question is: do you invest a lot of money to replace the panels for only a 20-25% increase, or invest nothing and still collect 40+% energy after 100 years.     
(In both cases the electronic inverters will need some 10-15year repair/replacement occasionally.)     

Upgrading turbines is tricky.    
The towers + foundation are engineered for a specific Wattage, you can keep those old 1MW turbines running by scavenging the scrap yards for spare parts, but they won't support a modern 8MW turbine.    
Besides, most of those towers are made of [steel](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/rusted-wind-turbines-19545416.jpg), and a ""Never mind maintenance, it's profits I am after"" attitude is not unheard of.

321,Rocksteady2R,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I work in the solar world, I definitely keep my ears open on the wind - it was a close call whether I was going to do solar or wind.  I'll give your questions a shot.

1)  wind is strong and going.  Texas alone has been kicking ass.  New York was on the radar a few years ago.  There is definitely progress in the field.  I'll say this though - Let's clarify Small Wind and Big Wind.  Small wind is a tough sell - single farmers with 5kW-250kW wind turbines are something of a hard sell.  (5kW is a small house turbine, 250kW could handle a pretty decently sized farming operation).   The real progress is in Big Wind - MegaWatt Turbines in the turbine farms you see on the news.  AND - to lead into #5 - there is lots of progress overseas.  In so many ways they're leaps and bounds ahead of us.

2)  Can't speak for sure, but... I've little doubt it would take a fair amount of phone calling and networking.  If you've got *any* electrical/mechanical experience - start brushing it up.  If you're not - start setting a plan.  I am, however, just talking ""guys in the field"".  Wind farms are huge, huge operations that exist in the office 3 years before ground even gets broken, let alone the tie-in.  You could go financing, policy making, operations management, public relations - all sorts of avenues.    

3)  that leads to qualifications - whatever you've got, start making use of it.  and do a shit-ton of reading and research.  You could easily pick up a couple books on the industry and start reading.  [I'm sure there's a few trade magazines out there - i've always had luck with a basic google search.](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=free+wind+trade+magazine).  Start researching like you did in school - brain maps and flow charts... start wrapping your head around the topic so you can at least talk the talk.   

4)  I don't know.  start googlin'.  do that research.  make a plan.  

5)  Definitely.  all over.  Also consider off-shore - there's jack shit in the US ( the *first* one just got cleared sometime in the last year, I don't stink they're building yet.)  but in Europe they're going real strong with off-shore.",1454979111.0

331,Southernskibum,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Well, I think I'm qualified to answer pretty much all of these. This post even motivated me to make a new username since ""fratstar"" isn't to professional. I'm a Field Engineer with the largest renewable energy contractor in the US. Two years into this industry I love what I do and I've made a pretty good life doing it. So, onto the questions.

1) Yes the wind industry is strong and its going to continue to be more so. For starters, Wind led the US in new installed generating capacity in 2015 at just shy of 50%, beating out natural gas by about 33%. See http://ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2015/dec-infrastructure.pdf for more detailed numbers. What you will want to know going forward is that the PTC/ITC extensions passed in December are massive for us. The business entities now have a foresight that our industry hasn't ever had. Historically, the gov't passes a one year extension at the last possible moment within a fiscal year. This time we got a 5 year wind credit that starts tapering down from 2017 to 2019 ending at 40% current value and solar has an 8 year ITC that doesn't start lowering until 2019. I'm dead serious when I say that the people in my company that knows whats up were literally popping bottles that day. I did too, because that extension is going to make my bonus checks look absolutely absurd for the next few years.
Going forward beyond 2019 into the 2020s you're going to see coal plants continuing to retire and nuclear plants not getting their licenses renewed. Renewables and Natural Gas are going to be counted on to replace that generating fleet. As on now wind and solar are only behind gas in terms of cost, with certain areas of the country having them ahead. That trend is going to continue to favor renewables as supply chains further optimize with the greater market visibility. 
Lastly for this point, consider climate based action and the Clean Power Plan. Basically, we're an international leader in everything and we made promises in Paris that we are expected to live up to. At the moment the CPP says that by 2030 each state will be 30% below 2005 carbon emission levels and how they get there is up to them. Some states are pitchin a bitch about it in court (TX, KY, MT mainly) but in the big picture change is coming whether they like it or not. If you really want to know more on that, let me know and I'll fill you in.

2)  Yes it's hard to get into. You either need someone to vouch for you or get lucky. This is mainly driven by the fact that we (industry management) have been burned to many times. Its a tough job with long hours and lots of travel. We've seen too many guys come in, get trained up and then get homesick and call it game. The other side is having someone who completely sucks but you can't quite fire the guy. The number one thing I tell my guys before I push for them is that they better not make me look stupid for bringing them in or else they're without a job and down a friend. I think that's fair considering this is business.

3) This is where things can get a little trickier. There are two sides to this business, construction and O&amp;M (operations and maintenance). In construction, the only time your degree matters is if you want to come in as management and then you want an engineering degree or construction management. I do have a good buddy of mine who has a video production degree or something like that but he has years of experience in the field from before school and he's extremely well connected. I believe most successful people call that networking, so no animosity from this guy. If you want to roll the dice and see if you can start in management, start applying for Field Engineer positions. Honestly though, without any experience or anyone knowing who you are, your chances are pretty slim.
For the actual construction side of building these projects, you don't need to have any experience at all. I don't think I'm being overly simplistic when I say these are basically lego sets. I'm not building 150 towers, I'm building 1 tower 150 times. Crews are set up into their specialized areas and it's like a train rolling across the project from offload components to mechanical completion. 
All of that said, I know next to nothing about the O&amp;M side of life. These are the permanent jobs that stay at the site for years. I do know that some manufacturers include a O&amp;M piece in their Turbine Supply Agreement (TSA) where they supply technicians for the next X number of years. On the project I just finished Vestas is providing techs for the next 5 years and I imagine some of them will stay after that if the client wants to make them an offer. The downside there is no per diem, which is the flat rate daily amount the road guys get to cover being on the road which is usually an extra couple grand on top of the higher wages. 
This is probably a good time to mention that there is a difference in working for the contractor and working for the turbine manufacturer, like a Vestas or GE. They have their own techs that do commissioning, which is putting the turbine online and running it through its shake down to fix any immediate problems. I won't pretend to know what they're looking for because I honestly don't know.

4) I've already told you that to come in as management you need an engineering degree or construction management degree and for field hands you don't need anything. If you want to look at O&amp;M or turbine manufacturers, you can check out Mesa Lands at http://www.mesalands.edu/academic-programs/degrees-certificates/wind-energy-technology-program/ I hear those guys have a pretty good placement rate but I haven't looked into it to much. Honestly its just not a skill set we need. 

5) If you go into the construction side, I can guarantee you that you will be moving around the country. That's just how this game works. Generally you can expect to be in one place for 3-6 months as a field hand before moving on to the next. A note of caution here; be prepared to be laid off. Projects are not always back to back, particularly during the winter months. My company does a pretty good job of keeping the guys that want to keep working at work, but some guys choose to take that time to go home for extended periods while they can. We are the exception. I know a lot of guys that went to a competitor for promises of higher wages just to finish a project and get laid off. If you manage your money though you can easily do just fine. 

I hope that at least gave you a starting point. If you have a short question I can answer it here. If you want more information and some deeper pointers on getting into this, DM me and we can set up a phone call.  Best of luck to you.",1455662527.0

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s renewable energy sector reached new heights yesterday, exactly a week after the country saw clean energy meet 95% of its power needs.

&gt; Despite cool conditions across much of the country on Sunday, high winds and prolonged periods of sunshine during the middle of the day meant that clean energy met pretty much 100% of Germany&amp;#039;s power needs at that time, having reached 95% on the previous Sunday, May 8.

&gt; As increased volumes of intermittent renewable power comes on to the grid, Germany has identified a handful of approaches designed for dealing with these new challenges, including more storage, more interconnectors and maybe the exclusion of certain regions from future onshore wind power auctions.

""The siting of wind facilities to minimize visual impacts to high-value scenic resources presents a major challenge for land management agencies in the western United States.

often visible at 39 km (24 mi).""

 ",1466320476.0
376,CharlieBra7o,wind,t5_2qyr2,"OK, first of, you need to draw a hard line between designing a **wind turbine** and designing a **wind park**. Two completely different things, as turbines are always designed for a wind class and not a wind park location. For wind parks, I don't think that **CFD** is used at all. Wind park design has **a lot** of factors and you always (in wind energy) design for at least 20 years. The most calculations that have to be done here are not regarding the airflow. And the ones that are normally use simpler mathematical methods such as [WAsP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAsP), which are way more efficient than CFD and yield very good results. The only thing where you would/should use CFD (to my knowledge) is when the terrain is very steep (e.g. wind park in the mountains).

Secondly: **HAWT vs. VAWT** (horizontal vs. vertical axis wind turbine). The short answer here is: VAWT are *never* used if efficiency is the main concern (i.e. commercial wind parks). This is simply due to the fact, that the VAWT blades have a rotational component *against* the wind on one side - resulting in a noticably lower efficiency. To give you a number: large, good HAWT operate with a cP (power coefficient = efficiency factor) of above 0.5, whereas VAWT reach something around 0.3. The [theoretical limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) is 16/27 = 0.59. Due to the VAWT's everchanging nature in spinning ""with/against"" the wind arise lots and lots of secondary issues (e.g. bad dynamics), which I won't address here.

Now, the rotor blades: designing a new rotor blade is a process that takes a couple of years. I can't give you an exact number here, sorry. However, the thing with wind turbines is that they are *not* modular. This is because you always have to consider interaction of the structural loads on all the parts involved. This is an absolutely **crucual** factor, because the turbine is supposed to run for a *looong* time. This means that the structural dynamics need to be looked at (or rather simulated) very carefully in order for it not to fall apart after a couple of years. So you *always* need to look at the *entire* system during the design process. Furthermore, since the certification process is for *entire* WT you cannot just put together parts from here and there anyway... Regarding **CFD**: Forst of, the main issue of rotor blades nowadays, due to the enormous length, is the structural aspect. So you can't ""just run CFD and be done with it"" ;) Like said in the first paragraph, it is similar with blade design. Rotor blades consist of many different ""precalculted"" blade sections (radially) for which all kinds of coefficients are simulated in either software or a wind channel. These coefficients then are used to calculate the actual performance of the entire rotor blade with [BEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_element_momentum_theory). BTW: as a rule of thumb the rotor blades make up about 1/3 of an entire wind turbine, which costs about 1M EUR per MWp.

**CFD with WT in general**: AFAIK, just like [FEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), you CFD is only used to either research physical phenomena or to validate a ""finished"" project. A big issue is, that rotor blades can [stall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_\(fluid_mechanics\)). Stall is a problem that is not very well understood and therefore *cannot* be calculated with CFD properly.",1466331051.0
377,CharlieBra7o,wind,t5_2qyr2,"You are definitely right there. What I meant with the use of FEM and CFD ist basically, that the rotor would be modelled as a finite element beam model in an aeroelastic simulation to get the loads of interest for all the design load cases (that's all the different situations you have to simulate, see [IEC 61400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61400)). It's because this simulations take *a lot* of time and would take like a trillion times longer with high resolution CFD simulations (**because of the many degrees of freedom**), which would, in ""normal"" circumstances, result in 99% the same results anyway. With these loads you can then go back and perform ""only one"" 3D FEM in high res to get a detailed picture of what's going on ""under the hood"", or rather ""inside the laminate"". So in a nutshell: you just simplify the problem (reduce degrees of freedom) to make it solve *a lot* faster but remain most of the accuracy when done correctly (in combination with 3D FEM).

Basically what I was trying to express with my original response is that there are *a great many* different steps involved in both wind turbine and wind park design that have to be looked at *separately* when trying to answer the OPs questions. I just didn't want to get into too much detail and completely escalate my response, so some things might be a little unclear :l",1466355750.0

382,Marvin_Dent,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Of course the tools are used,  you have to know their limits, though: FEM can be used to model deflections, eigenfrequencies and stress,  but modelling the layers of fibres, foam or wood cores correctly is difficult. For fatigue you look at 10^9 cycles, but materials are usually only tested for 10^7.

CFD is a good tool to validate certain operating points, get insight into flow conditions and verify calculated loads. Possible improvements for wind turbines are low percentages (1-3%), just in the error margin for CFD. 

Have a look what is currently published in journals: load reduction for next generation turbines, optimized control and planning of maintenance by use of scada data, park power coefficient optimization, cost reduction,  perhaps some floating offshore concepts and their grid connection.

No, it needs a (very) high rpm to produce some useful energy, and they have a lousy ~50% efficiency.      

On your link the 350-1000W motors have 2250-3000 rpm at the specified voltage, that rpm is more or less linear with the voltage (3000 rpm @ 48V =&gt; 750 rpm @ 12V).      

[Betz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) says the power is linear with the rotor area pi.r² and with windspeed^cubed .    
For a 3-bladed turbine the recommended tip speed ratio [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio) is about 7.    
The first thing you need to do is measure the hourly windspeed at the location/height of your proposed turbine (for a year), then you have to balance all that information to get a suitable design.      
From your windspeed (m/s) you calculate the (windspeed x TSR =) speed at the circumference of the turbine blade, and from that and the rotor diameter you get the turbine-hub rpm.    
A larger blade gives more power but lower rpm/voltage, find the balance with the motor/generator specs.

387,rabidmob,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I realize this is an old post, but hoping to help, I am however a bit of a noob too.

Phones use direct current, DC, computers typically plug into alternating current, AC. If you're looking to power both, you'll probably need to use an inverter to convert DC generated current into AC. You could generate AC, however that would most likely be difficult directly.

If I recall correctly with DC motors, RPM is based on volatge, inversely with generators voltage is variable based on the RPM of the motor. With AC motors, RPM is based on frequency (of the alternation) and inversely with an alternator (AC generator) electric frequency is based on RPMs.

I think if you were to look up youtube videos of, ""fan wind turbine,' you'll find people taking AC motors from ceiling fans and converting them to wind turbines. I believe they then run the current to a rectifier, then a capacitor (or battery perhaps). If you want to then plug in AC devices, you would need to add an inverter to convert back to AC at the standard voltage and frequency.

When designing your circuit, you'll want to pay attention to the voltage and amperage tolerances of the equipment as you'll generally want to ensure that you don't damage the equipment if your wind turbine starts spinning too quickly. You may want to place a fuse or breaker in the circuit as a precaution.",1468881727.0

It just doesn't make economic sense.  Offshore works in Europe because there are pretty hardcore subsidy schemes and NIMBY is super strong keeping onshore development down (plus population is denser so there are actually fewer areas to build).

Along the eastern seaboard there is some room for offshore development.  But 80 GW is hundreds of billions of dollars.  There are a limited number of players with the experience to build offshore wind, and I don't think very many of them are going to be jumping at the power prices offered.",1473661142.0
396,WeeblsLikePie,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;""that kind of level"" - 86 GW capacity is probably going to be about 40 GW average generation. Out of what, around 500-600 GW average demand currently, and that's *before* everything gets electrified? So well under 10% of demand. That's not huge scale, is it?

That's like justifying a goal of pasturing 400,000 head of cattle in Manhattan by saying ""well look there are 98.4 million head in the us. 400,000 isn't very much.""


&gt;And economically, it does make sense. Offshore is getting cheaper, and offering this sort of long-term commitment is just what's needed to give investors some certainty: and that translates into lower costs and inward investment in manufacturing capability.

Offshore is getting a bit cheaper, but solar is getting cheaper faster. Offshore operation costs are pretty high, and the power prices in Europe at the best sites are at the 100 euro/MWH sort of level these days.  That's below retail prices for power in the US, but probably doesn't give enough profit at current prices to justify a couple billion dollars of investment.  So like I said, I'm not opposed to offshore, it'll probably make sense at some point.  But I don't think it makes sense in the 5-10 year time frame in the US.

""The facilities were found to be visible to the unaided eye at &gt;36 mi (58 km) under optimal viewing conditions, with turbine blade movement often visible at 24 mi (39 km). Under favorable viewing conditions, the wind facilities were judged to be major foci of visual attention at up to 12 mi (19 km) and were likely to be noticed by casual observers at &gt;23 mi (37 km). A conservative interpretation suggests that for such facilities, an appropriate radius for visual impact analyses would be 30 mi (48 km), that the facilities would be unlikely to be missed by casual observers at distances of up to 20 mi (32 km), and that the facilities could be major sources of visual contrast at distances of up to 10 mi (16 km).""

There's also the matter of red lights flashing at night, which can cut through those distances. And ships will need to avoid more and more junk in the water. You have to admit that it's all part of the same industrial continuum. The sheer numbers of these machines needed to make much difference is staggering. A pipe-dreamer named Jacobson from Stanford came up with ""3.8 million large wind turbines"" and proposed that many of them be offshore, but just getting a few dozen or a hundred installed meets plenty of resistance. Pro wind power arguments routinely cite absolute best case scenarios in terms of ""careful siting,"" noise, bird/bat kills and many other factors. It's time for people to stop blindly accepting those claims just because the machines don't directly emit fumes. That's really all that's green about them.",1474590470.0

&gt; What would be your main motivating factors in purchasing a wind turbine blade with an active twist angle? Rank from most to least important.

Not sure I can think of a ton of reasons. I'm assuming ""active twist"" isn't the same as blade pitching. Being able to active twist could allow give us a mechanism for reducing stresses on the blades and rotor even faster than blade pitch and individual blade pitch control (IPC) methods. Imagine if there was a sudden gust of wind that maybe wasn't picked up perfectly by a MET tower upstream, as soon as the rotor/blades feel the extra localized stress from that gust, they could use some sort of active twist to quickly mitigate those loads. 

&gt;   What features would you want to see in the wind turbine blade?

Anything that can reduce loads or even make maintenence easier. A blade that does maintenance on itself could be valuable. Now that places like Japan and Gulf Coast USA are wanting turbines, having blades/rotors/towers that can withstand typhoons and hurricanes would be valuable. 

&gt;   Do you think the active twist is feasible and why?

Economically speaking? I don't think it's feasible anytime soon but it depends on how expensive the tech to make it happen is. I've seen some interesting work being done that could make it possible but I doubt it will be implemented anytime soon. 

&gt;   What are the pros and cons of using wind turbines compared with other forms of renewable energy?

Right now, wind energy in the midwest is cheaper than any other renewable energy (at least according to a number I read). Turbines also offer an easy way to curtail power production if there's too much power on the grid. By shutting off turbines you even extend their life since they undergo less stress. Solar is much harder to reduce the power output of. Wind can, in theory, be blowing at anytime of the day unlike solar. 

&gt;   Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve active twist on turbine blades?

Not really sure on that one. I just listened to a talk by a professor at my U who is [working on how materials can be knitted together and then heated to achieve an actuator \(twisting motion\)](http://www.me.umn.edu/people/abel.shtml) that can be used to control how air goes over airplane blades 

&gt;   What do you expect from a wind turbine blade? (what are the basic needs)
&gt;   What characteristics would you be interested in seeing in a wind turbine blade that go above and beyond the standards?

It needs to be as cheap as possible and last for 20-30 years with the least amount of maintenance as possible. Keeping the rotor spinning is also the major point of them.

437,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;  the nose cone's shape really doesn't matter aerodynamically, given how little wind is caught at the root section of the blades.       

In a highly competitive market even those last 2% count, but most manufacturers still use a round blade-root that can not convert that energy, and therefore claim ""it's not important"", obviously.      

Although that GE prototype nosecone does do its job of redirecting the wind towards the start of the aerodynamic portion of the blade, that aerodynamic shape is still the 'old' model and that extra airflow does change the AoA and efficiency of that blade part.      

Another (better) example is the Enercon [E126](http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2011/10/enercon-e126-001.jpg) blade root design.

irst, the formula for power contained in the wind doesn't provide a good estimate for what you can extract.  Primarily because of the [Betz Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law).  Which says that you can only extract 59% of the energy in the wind.

The reason for this, in simple terms, is because in order to extract all of the kinetic energy in the wind you'd have to bring the air to a stop (kinetic energy is energy of motion--if it's moving at all it's still got some energy in it).  If you've stopped the air, then you can't bring any more air though, because you've got stopped air blocking the way. So you can slow the air down some...and Betz' law tells you how much you can slow it down.  So if you were to take that formula you'd be overestimating by at LEAST 40%.

So yeah. You need the powercurve.  But depending on what your goal is you also need to think carefully about your wind data.  How many years of data do you have? Are you sure your years are typical years?  Are they whole years, or do you have more winters than summers?  These things all matter to making sure your energy predictions are correct.

Then you have to think about where you might be losing energy.  Once you get a powercurve I can almost promise you the turbine will not hit those numbers.  The numbers are for ideal conditions.  So that's one loss. Then you're going to have electrical losses. There might be ice on your blades, causing losses.  The blades might be dirty, causing losses.  Etc etc etc.

So there's a lot to think about. If you say a bit more about what you're trying to calculate I'm happy to provide some help, but it's hard to say without knowing what you're really looking for.

While others will probably disagree, I would strongly recommend doing the AAS over the short course. In my opinion, the short courses are best suited to folks who either have a fair amount of technical experience and are looking to get into the industry or folks who don't have much technical experience and are in a big hurry to get into an entry level position.  

The curriculum from the AAS program in the link you posted looks pretty comprehensive and checks the boxes for most of the knowledge areas I look for when we bring an applicant in for an interview. That course work should give you good foundation to get started as a wind tech.  Another benefit to the AAS is that much of the curriculum is applicable to all kinds of industrial automation and maintenance type work, so you still have a healthy range of options should you have trouble finding work in wind. Getting some additional hands-on experience with an internship is probably equally as important as the degree coursework. Does the school help with internship placements?  

I went the AAS route back in '07-'08 but only completed about 3/4 of  the degree. Ended up not finishing because I was offered a full time position after summer internship.  Right out of school I worked primarily in medium scale wind (50kW to 100kW) doing installation and maintenance throughout the Midwest before getting hired on by a turbine manufacturer and getting to work all over the US and UK. After a few years of working as a technician and as a support ""engineer"", I'm now working part-time doing Operations and Maintenance type work on community scale projects (large turbines installed in smaller groups of 1-3) while finishing up an EE degree.  

Its probably worth mentioning that many entry level positions can require a fair amount of travel, but there are a fair number of permanent windfarm positions out there. A few years field experience in combination with your other degrees would very likely open doors to all kinds of opportunity. ",1491192076.0
544,internoodle,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I hope someone with better technical chops answers this for you. I've been pondering a similar addition to my RV where I already have solar and was thinking of adding a 500 watt wind turbine to the mix.

I do like your idea of using any excess power to heat water off the dump load.

I can't help but thinking though that using a charge controller removes some complexity and guess work in trying to cipher up the correct load. Yes, a charge controller doesn't take full advantage of generation but is also less to manage and maintain?

Anyway, I look forward to input from folks with more experience while I am just thinking out loud.",1491223702.0
545,KiedroD,wind,t5_2qyr2,"To be honest, adding more solar would likely be your best bet. 500 watts doesn't sound like a lot power, but to have a rotor large enough to yield 500 watts at a reasonable wind speed will require somewhat substantial tower.  Also to get the turbine up into laminar (smooth) air flow you really want to be at least 30 feet above any obstructions within 500 feet. A tower that is strong enough to support the turbine and tall enough to get you up into good wind will likely be a huge pain to cart around with you. ",1491237445.0
546,KiedroD,wind,t5_2qyr2,"You're not out in left field at all. 

The difficulty in charge controlling wind turbine output versus PV output into a battery bank is that the vast majority of turbines really do not appreciate being unloaded.

The charge controller delivers less charge current to the battery bank as state of charge approaches 100% and then all but stops after the batteries are charged. With PV, No problem. PV modules are easy going and their output can be ""throttled down"" very easily by the charge controller. 

For wind turbine, its output must go somewhere to keep a load on the rotor and prevent the rotor from overspeeding. That's part of why you see diversion load on the turbine charge controller, when the turbine output isn't going to the battery it gets re-routed to the controller diversion load. By forgoing a charge controller on the turbine, the rotor will always be loaded by the battery bank, there won't be any MPPT function for the turbine output, but your system will have fewer components to worry about. 

If you do go the diversion load route its worth considering what happens should a diversion load fail or the water tank exceeds a certain temperature. Some kind of auto shutdown on the turbine or a second diversion-load that dumps to air-cooled resistors would provide a nice additional layer of protection for your batteries. 

HomePower did nice write-up on using diversions loads a few years ago. I can't recommend them enough, a really great publication and an excellent way to see all kinds of different RE systems and configurations.

You have a 'permanent magnet' generator, whose generated voltage is linear(-ish) with its rpm, and that generator-rpm is ideally linear(-ish) with the wind-speed.     

Your [turbine type (number of blades)](http://www.scielo.cl/fbpe/img/ingeniare/v17n3/fig06-2.JPG) has an optimum 'tip speed ratio' [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio), from the *measured* wind-speed you can calculate the TSR at the circumference, divide by PI to get the generator rpm (and generated voltage) that belongs to that.

""Wind zone 2"" is 100 mph max, don't be too disappointed if you don't get that at your location (*but on the plus side, your house won't blow away either*).     
To at least understand what is happening, you might want to know the local wind speed, google-fu ""DIY anemometer"", and mount that very close to the actual turbine location (without interference), and using those numbers in [Betz's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) will be useful.     

Ideally you want to build an [MPPT controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking).    
Using an r/Arduino or similar, you obviously need to monitor your battery voltage, you can measure the generator voltage and current, multiplying he generator voltage x current while changing the current will tell you where that Mppt point is (Arduino?).    

At lower wind speeds the generator voltage is possibly not high enough, a bunch of (relay controlled) [buck-boost converters](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=buck+boost+cv+cc&amp;rmvSB=true&amp;_sop=15&amp;_fspt=1&amp;LH_BIN=1&amp;_mPrRngCbx=1&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xbuck+boost+.TRS0&amp;_nkw=buck+boost+&amp;_sacat=0) could solve that problem (adjusted to 30V with a current limiting resistor?).

560,bfoshizzle1,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I'd say the main reason why that isn't such a great idea is because of the second law of thermodynamics: using work to generate heat is bad because it's irreversible- you cannot transform the same heat back into the same amount of work (for more on that, look up the Carnot cycle). If you use work to generate heat, you cannot use that heat to generate work at 100% efficiency, but that leads to something cool: you can use work to pump a greater amount of heat from a cooler body to a hotter body at greater than 100% efficiency using a heat pump. Using a heat pump, you aren't creating energy (which would violate the first law of thermodynamics), but you can use a heat pump to move a greater amount of heat from the outside environment than it consumes (which is perfectly legal by both the first and second laws of thermodynamics). If you were to reverse that heat pump and use it as a heat engine, and assuming it was the maximum efficiency that it could be between a certain temperature difference (which is less the 100%, and become smaller as the temperature between the heat source and the cold sink gets smaller and smaller), and you were to store the work generated to drive a heat pump at maximum efficiency at the same temperature difference, then you end up back where you started, meaning the process is reversible and no entropy was generated, meaning it was at maximum efficiency (because entropy can only be generated, never destroyed; that is the meaning of the second law: that while energy can never be created or destroyed, it can change form and it is often impossible to change it back into its original form). The reason why you should not use work to directly generate heat (using friction or resistive heating) is because that is ~100% efficient, but only 100% efficient, and if you wanted to turn that heat back into work, you could only do it at a much lower efficiency (let's say 33%), and you'd end up with less work than you started out with, whereas if you used work to pump heat as opposed to directly generating it, then you could end up with much greater efficiency (say 300%), meaning you end up with three times as much heat as the amount of work that you put in (but if you were to use that heat to generate work using a maximum efficiency heat pump/engine that is fully reversible, then you'd end up with the exact same amount of work you started out with).",1494549360.0

The cost to maintain and repair turbines is high. The more turbines you have, the more failures may occur.

But without sources I can give you an idea as to why.

As outlined in that NREL report, there's three types of relations between size and mass (cost):

1) The blades, hub, shaft, gearbox, generator: scale with radius with a power of 2.5-3.

2) The tower, which scales differently, but almost similar.

3) Everything else, like capital costs, maintenance costs, zoning costs, installation costs, transport costs. These costs are all pretty different, and most of them do not scale exponentionally.

Then there's energy production. Energy production scales with radius with the power of a little over 2. 2.3-2.4 if I recall correctly.

So you're right Annual Energy Production (AEP) scaling does not match the scaling laws of the type 1 costs. There's a gap. However, if you take type 2 and 3 into account, the total costs may scale closer to AEP or even below it. 

This is basically the battle all wind energy manufacturers are facing. To beat the scaling laws, and since they're producing larger turbines every year, they seem to be winning.

This is already true for onshore wind. For offshore wind this isn't as big of an issue actually. The costs that do not increase exponentially make up a larger chunk in offshore than they do onshore. Maintenance, installation, cables etc, are more important. For offshore the scaling laws are actually easier to beat than onshore.

Even assuming that he somehow manages to encourage US oil companies to produce more oil, that just lowers the global oil price.

The rule of thumb is 2.5 rotor diameters for anything.

The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized ""actuator disk"" that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind.

617,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Yeah, that's pretty impossible to answer in a reddit post, and way too many variables to take into account. Let's get some requirements out of the way:

**Aerodynamic**

First of all, you need to select your control mechanism. Pitch control (best, but unlikely for a small turbine), passive stall control, or (semi-)active stall control. This determines your power curve and design points. Also, number of blades and blade length would be nice to pin down here. (Blade length would be somewhere between 2.5m-5m I'd wager.)

Secondly, your blade needs to get the most power out of the available wind. That requires knowledge of the desired power curve (P vs incoming wind), and ultimately you will select your rated wind speed and tip-speed-ratio.

Once you know that, you can start designing the blade plan form. Chord, pitch, airfoil at different radial positions. This follows from the optimum power exchange. It is not that hard, but requires at minimum knowledge of Blade-Element-Momentum (BEM) method. You can also grab a wind turbine engineering book and just use the relations. Perhaps you may even find yourself an online calculator or some excel sheet floating around the internet. The actual rough design is not that hard. 

And, unless you select a flat plate as your airfoil (for 5kW, a flat plate isn't going to cut it), you need some airfoil data. Also, not that hard to find online.

You're probably going for stall control. Unfortunately I don't really know the limitations and design criteria for that, as I've never worked with those designs. Designing for that should follow from your airfoil data and BEM-calculations though.

**Structural**

For a 5 kW turbine you're looking at 1-3 kN of thrust, probably more. That's quite something. You need to take into account the design of your hub connection (0 \&lt;r&lt;0.3R). So how do you make the transition from airfoil to your hub connection? Also, how do you make the structural design of the blade itself? This especially imposes limits on your minimum chord size and minimum blade thickness.

Also, maximum thrust is not the only thing. You better take fatigue into account.

**Manufacturing**
How are you going to produce it? What are your tolerances? Just like the structural design, this imposes additional limits on your blade design.

**Anything else**
Those are the basic things to keep in mind. Later on in the design you need to take stuff like stability, stall behavior, pitch control, and blade components such as water drains into account.",1500460818.0

633,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I don't really get what your idea is about the conveyor belt.

You're right that the outer part of the blade does most of the work, but your other assumptions are a bit less valid.

1. You can't just cut out the large 'non-contributing' part. It will eat into your aerodynamic efficiency. Induced drag and the tip loss effect will play a larger role. Actually, the longer I think about it, the more I am convinced you won't get close to the efficiency you had with a full blade.

2. Rotational stresses play a minor role in blade and turbine loading. It's about 10% of blade root stress. Wind turbines are lift based machines, and therefore generate an enormous amount of aerodynamic lift and drag. Those are the real forces we are talking about. If you want to create a turbine which has comparable power generation, you will generate comparable thrust. Therefore, your support structure will still be the same.

3. Blades do not weight that much. For example for the Vestas 112, 3MW, the blades together only make up 33 tonnes of the total 288 tonnes. So if you cut out the blades, you are not winning much mass wise. And since we already established that your forces will stay the same, the rest of the assembly will not go down in weight.

Kite power, and Makani power do get advantages from only using the outer 10%, because their entire energy generation concept is different. 

So, to answer your question. State your assumptions. Investigate whether they are true. Define your concept/hypothesis. And proof your concept/hypothesis.

In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. The principle is named after Daniel Bernoulli who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.

Bernoulli's principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow, resulting in various forms of Bernoulli's equation; there are different forms of Bernoulli's equation for different types of flow. The simple form of Bernoulli's equation is valid for incompressible flows (e.g.

**Betz's law**

Betz's law indicates the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind, independent of the design of a wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919, by the German physicist Albert Betz. The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized ""actuator disk"" that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind.

I have only held one position in the industry and have 9+ months in that position, so my opinion is a bit limited but here it is. 

The 6 month school was very helpful, it did knock some of the stupid off of me. I enjoyed learning some of the terminology and a good deal of safety was driven into us by the school. Safety is key, you'll have a very hard time in industry if you can't speak and act safety. That said, I don't think it's strickly necessary to have one of these courses to get a job in industry. If you have any prior experience with hydraulic, electrical or mechanical work, it will give you a huge leg up. 

As for the rope access, that is physically demanding and mentally challenging. If you have any fear of heights, any whatsoever, don't pursue that line of wind work. I have seen a man freeze on top of the nacelle and stay there for literal hours. It is much easier to work on the inside of a tower if you have a fear of heights. At least 3 of my colleagues have pretty intense fear of heights and they do just fine inside. 

Also, to be competitive in the market today, you almost universally have to be willing to be mobile. Sometimes 100%. This is nice and sucky. You will be in hotels, a lot and never really start a routine. Romance is difficult to say the least and no pets. But, if that's not an issue, travel generally means a much larger paycheck.

I have always had stunt motorcycles that I would break and have to repair so before getting into wind, I was fairly set on how to ""make it work."" Turbines are immensely more complicated machines, especially when you get into how DFIG generators work and how the turbine ""cleans the power"" before sending it to the grid.

*****
&gt; When a 155-megawatt wind farm in West Texas began commercial operation this month, it pushed the state&amp;#039;s wind power capacity to more than 20,000 megawatts, surpassing 19,800 megawatts of capacity from coal-fired power plants, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees 90 percent of the state&amp;#039;s grid.

&gt; While ERCOT still gets most of its power from natural gas and coal, wind power generation now accounts for 15 percent of the power mix - up from just 2 percent a decade ago.

&gt; As wind power claims a greater share in Texas&amp;#039; electricity mix, the state&amp;#039;s merchant power operators are struggling to adapt to a power market that has been already upset by low natural gas prices and the high cost of operating coal and nuclear power plants.

However wind turbine technicians are one of the fastest growing occupations, in Europe as well as in the USA.

Then you need a Power Management unit to ensure you get decent power quality with few variations in voltage and frequency.

I have a slightly biased answer for you.

I went to a wind farm interview and was asked if I had climbed a turbine before, if I had used a hydraulic torque wrench, and if I had used a megger. I knew what the functions of the tools were but I was only able to answer no to all of those questions.

I've since enrolled in Mesalands community college and have climbed their on site 1.5MW GE turbine half a dozen times, preformed greasing, cleaning, inspections and check the generator allignement. I will have used a hydraulic torque wrench and megger by the end of this semester.

I wanted the hands on experience after answering no in the interview. Mesalands is and affordable option for hands on schooling. If I remember correctly it's around $2500 per semester for out of state.

733,ZodiacX,wind,t5_2qyr2,"As /u/dontpet says, the results have shown the yields to be lower than competitively viable. Here are few of the issues which the promo video glosses over or doesn't bring up:

* The kites can fly in storms, but will have issues with weathering and wet flight. Regular high winds and rain will result in very heavy wear and very regular maintenance. Having the generator low also makes sea-water wear and adequate protection a significant issue since the tethers will naturally direct water into the reels. Though, to be fair the maintenance would arguably be cheaper for any individual visit and easier. 

* Similarly, the platforms may bob in tsunami waves but will still be restricted by the anchoring method (since you can't just let these float freely in the ocean, needing to stay connected to the grid and all). Bobbing to these extremes will also produce significant fatigue loads on the kites and tethers if left flying.

* The platforms may be smaller but the area of clearance needed becomes an issue of how deep the anchor point is, you need a cone of clearance in all directions around the anchor point which only grows the taller the cone is. This is not an insignificant area as it stretches to the ends of the active kite range forming a snowcone-shaped area of coverage.

* The active controls to maintain two kites flying without interference and to reel them back after flying out all negatively impacts the energy output. The reeling in especially, either you are dragging the kites back usually through the same winds they just generated power on, or you can dry to drag them back through the water which usually isn't any better and requires relaunching.

&gt; you can try to drag them back through the water which usually isn't any better  

To reel in the kites they are brought overhead so that their angle to the wind is minimal (think of an airplane wing, it's parallel to the ground and the wind flows over it smoothly).

&gt; Bigger turbines harvest more energy, more steadily; the bigger they get, the less variable and more reliable they get, and the easier they are to integrate into the grid.

&gt; What wind turbines are getting up to To get a handle on how big this new GE turbine is, let&amp;#039;s start with some comparisons.

&gt; &amp;quot;Wind at 60% capacity factor,&amp;quot; he wrote, &amp;quot;Even at the same price per kwh of today, would be tremendously more valuable than it is now, with fewer limits to how much of it we could use. Why is that? Several reasons. The more variable a source is, the more backup is needed to firm it up and make it reliable. By making wind less variable and more reliable, higher capacity factors reduce backup costs. Variable renewable energy tends to&amp;quot;eat its own lunch.

A programmable logic controller (PLC), or programmable controller is an industrial digital computer which has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, or robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability control and ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.

They were first developed in the automobile industry to provide flexible, ruggedised and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relays, timers and sequencers. Since then they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments. A PLC is an example of a ""hard"" real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.

Operator profitability varies hugely, because there is such a wide range of payment schemes around the world.

Medium speed drives with synchronous machines and permanent magnets also offer a high efficiency. It is kind of counterintuitive to see this offshore but it seems like there have been major improvements in the reliability of gearboxes lately. Also a modular drive train concept may make sense even offshore. The exchange of a gearbox is certainly less painful than the removal of the entire drive rotor\-nacelle assembly \- direct drives have a highly integrated mechanical design \(think bearing damage\). Finally, I do not think that medium drives are *the* profitable option. GE goes for a direct drive in their upcoming 12 MW, but MHI Vestas is very successful with their 9\+ MW machine using a gearbox.

849,FreeYourselfNow,wind,t5_2qyr2,"There are a lot of responses, though it's hard to predict what a Trumpster will find suitable.

First, just theoretically, it doesn't make any sense to imagine that wind energy uses a lot of energy. Maybe building and installing the turbine is energy intensive, but once they're installed the wind just blows them. If wind energy were truly not energy efficient, that would show up in the cost of power produced by wind turbines. Yet, [wind power is by far the cheapest source on a $/MWh basis](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/). If it's inefficient, investors wouldn't be funneling money into it because you have to pay for the energy used to create it.

Second, MWhs needed to create wind energy isn't all that important. The amount of carbon dioxide produced in creating the MWhs is important. Wind energy is excellent on this metric compared to coal or natural gas.

The median wind energy power system emits about 11 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour produced in its life cycle, which included creating and installing the turbines ([Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x)).

[Quoting the Denver Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2014/01/natural-gas-power-plants-produce-40.html): 

* Coal-based power plants emitted  an average of 915 grams (32 ounces) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt  hour of electricity produced.
* Natural gas power plants emitted an average of 549 grams (19 ounces) CO2 per kilowatt hour.
* Combined cycle natural gas plants emitted an average 436 grams (15 ounces) CO2 per kilowatt hour.

Again, if wind power was energy intensive, that would show up in the amount of CO2 emitted in the life cycle of a wind turbine. It doesn't. That could mean wind power is almost entirely created using GHG free energy (which only comes from wind, nuclear, solar and hydro, basically), in which case it doesn't matter that much how energy intensive it is. Or, more likely, it means wind power is not that energy intensive.",1531438731.0
850,grandma_alice,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Yeah, that's total crap. Over the course of their lifetime, wind turbines are expected to produce [20 times the amount of energy used to manufacture and install them](https://www.carbonbrief.org/energy-return-on-investment-which-fuels-win).  That means they pay back the energy that's used to make (and install) them in a year or less.  That article is now 5 years old and there's some subjectivity involved in its numbers, so take it with a grain of salt.  But Wind turbines have improved since the article was written and they have higher capacity factors and lower costs. Same goes for solar PV. Not so much for nuclear.

Think about it. The people who decide to invest their money to build wind farms are not dumb.  They're pretty smart, in fact.  If it took more energy to manufacture the wind turbine than the wind turbine generates in its lifetime, that would mean the cost of the wind turbine would be more than the amount of revenue they'd get from selling the power from the turbine.  The would be losing money.  Obviously they're not losing money on these things.

The post by jeremyRockit states the ROI is between 5 and 10 years.  This seems reasonable.   A 2 MW turbine would cost in the neighborhood of 3.2 Million dollars.  You can calculate the value of energy they generate by doing a little math. Wind turbines they install today should have a capacity factor of 40 - 45%.   The revenue from a wind farm comes from two sources. First there is the approximately $23 / Megawatt-hour from the production tax credit. Then there's the additional revenue from selling the electricity on the grid.  Often a wind farm will have A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in place that guarantees this revenue.  Recent PPA's are on the order of $21/ MW-hour.    So a good estimate of the total revenue would be $44 /MW hour.  The amount of hours in a year: 24*365.25 = 8766 hours. Electricity generated in a year:  2 MW * 8766 * .40 = 7012.8 MW-hr   Value of that electricity:
7012.8 * 44 = $308,563. Payback period:  $3,200,000(cost) / $308,563(revenue/year) = 10.37 years.

858,Skiffbug,wind,t5_2qyr2,"The theory behind it is that direct drive turbines are simpler and require less maintenance due to less moving parts. The nacelles are also lighter which has an effect on the amount of steel the tower requires. 

However, in practice it has been found that the failure rate between geared and direct drive turbines isn’t that different. The failures are for different things, but the rate is similar. 

Then you have the supply chain issue. Direct drive turbines require a large amount of rare earth metals. China has this market captive to a large extent, which causes both issues in price and in security of supply. Add to that the fact that most batteries also need rare earth metals and there is a battery boom, and it creates quite some issues. 

As a reflection of this, most major turbine manufacturers that had moved to direct drive are now moving back to geared. This is the case do Siemens (now Siemens-Gamesa), and I think Vestas has a direct drive, but not sure. Their feedback was the point above on failure rates and the fact that geared turbines are cheaper these days. ",1531859752.0

862,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"You’ve got the angles backwards. Or I am misunderstanding you. Either way, a sudden drop in wind speed is not a problem at high wind speeds.

First of all, as wind speed increases above rated wind speed, the blades are pitched so that the angle of attack is reduced. At higher wind speeds the blades are actually further from stall than at low wind speeds. As a matter of fact, at max wind speed the tip portion may actually have negative angle of attack: it produces negative energy.

Second of all, a drop in wind speed would reduce the angle of attack. You should draw the angles of wind velocity and rotational velocity. So you’d actually be concerned with stall when a gust increases the wind speeds. At high speeds a turbine would just pitch out of the wind when wind speed decreases, increasing the aoa.

Alright, so what happens at low wind speeds when the wind speed increases? Luckily gusts are proportional to the wind speed. But the critical point is, as usual, at rated power: highest loads and highest angle of attack. So at rated power you would build in a certain stall margin in your blade design to account for the typical gust. Rated angle of attack needs to have a certain margin to stall angle. And this margin needs to be  larger near the tip, as it is more important that the tip does not encounter stall. Also because weird stuff happens anyway at the tip.

Either way, I don’t think stall is that big of a deal for pitch regulated turbines. Angles of attack aren’t as near towards Clmax as in aircraft.

As for control, stall is probably a control design consideration. But gusts and the response at the rotor are taken into account in general. There are multiple secondary effects happening when there’s a gust or pitch change which are actually more important: dynamic stall (not much to do with stall actually) and dynamic inflow.",1532071130.0
863,cannibally,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Hi, generators are not my speciality, and I just know Nordex turbines by heart, but I will try to explain what I know:

There are alot of different techniques to control the output frequency, it depends on the type of the turbine. But in the most part it is through frequency modulation on the rotor part of the generator by the main converter.

When it's a turbine with a pitch system, the first thing is that it will try to keep a steady rotation speed on the drive train, so the pitch will change the angle for the different wind speeds. This happens almost in real time, and keeps the output freq of the generator as steady as possible.

Then the main part of controlling output is adding up the missing Hz on the generator's rotor's coils. For example: the generator is not yet up on it's determined rpm, and (without modulation) would throw out only 45Hz on the output. So the main converter, who also measures all frequencies in real time, just pulses the generator's rotor with the missing 15Hz, so that it automaticly adds up on the output and it throws out 60Hz.

This only applies to generators with conductor brushes, if my explaination is understandable at all...hope I could help",1532074657.0

865,JoinTeamHumads,wind,t5_2qyr2,"both this and the approach in the other comment are used! 

this one describes the doubly fed induction generator or DFIG, which is used in conjunction with massive multi stage gearboxes between the low speed shaft (wind turbine rotor) and high speed shaft (generator shaft). the pitch control system described above tries to keep everything spinning at the rated speed, designed such that the HSS is spinning at a frequency to support grid operation. for example a 6 pole generator needs to run at 60 Hz * 60 seconds per minute / (6/2) pole pairs per revolution  = 1200 RPM to produce 60 Hz power. the actual physical shaft speed is a bit higher for an induction generator because it needs slip to maintain a rotating magnetic field on the rotor. a DFIG is a special case of this where the rotor windings are actually controlled to make up for a slower-than-rated rotor, so that the stator perceives a rotating magnetic field at the correct RPM. in this way, a much smaller AC-DC-AC link can be used (just at the rotor!) to achieve the end result of producing 60 Hz power. note that the designed rated speed is still in the “positive slip” region because at that operation they can actually extract power from the rotor too. it’s a really fascinating design!

and as the other commenter said, the other approach is to use a synchronous machine (like a permanent magnet or wound field synchronous) which is in direct drive or maybe a small single stage gearbox with the rotor shaft, let it run at whatever speed it wants, and just slap a big converter on it. you want lots and lots of poles on a generator running this slow to keep efficiency up, among other reasons.

868,eldarandia,wind,t5_2qyr2,"thanks. appreciate it.

One question more. As i understand it, pitch controlled turbines pitch their blades out as the wind speed increases. What is the relation between producing rated power, pitch angle and wind speed? as an example, assume that a turbine can produce rated power at 12 m/s of wind speed and zero pitch angle. If the pitch angle increases to 10 degrees, what steady wind speed will be needed to continue to produce rated power?

where i'm going with this question is this: i've observed that during gusty winds, the power output of some turbines drops suddenly. I assumed this was due to aerodynamic stall but i now think it might be caused by the wind speed dropping and a large pitch angle.

Any books you're recommend to understand the aerodynamics of wind turbines?",1532196305.0
869,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"You can’t really estimate that easily I think, as it depends on radius, blade design, twist angles, tip speed ratio etc. The effective angle of attack depends on radial location, so anywhere you change the incoming wind speed the aoa is affected differently. And the total power output is a combination over the entire radius.

10 degrees feels like a lot though, but I am just digging into my memory now. Blade designs I have seen had a maximum negative pitch angle of 8 degrees if I am not mistaken. So going from 0 to -8 would cover the entire operating range. But I could be completely off here.

Nevertheless, if you’re a little familiar with aerodynamics you could quite easily calculate it using Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory, a model which you can easily build yourself in Excel. I can recommend ‘Wind Energy Explained’ by Manwell.

Let me know if you need more help, or are in dire need of an answer to that question. I have a BEM code lying around in which I could plug the NREL reference turbine to answer the question, a little too lazy to do that now though.

I work in wind and i found this to be very helpful when finding a wind energy outfit to work for. You can see who is hiring but also see WHERE they are hiring. I know techs are high in demand but i would recommend biting the bullet and moving to a region with a large concentration of wind resources. Wind Energy is completely changing the job landscape of rural areas so you might be up against new techs that also happen to live right down the road (in which case every company will pay the person nearby instead of the one on the other side of the country). 

I am very biased but if you are serious about making it a career, i would try the Columbia river valley in Oregon.  There is about 5000 MW (soon will be about 10,000 MW) of wind in short proximity from one another. You could live in a location such as the Dalles, White Salmon, or Hood River and have a great quality of life with cheap housing, and have a large number of wind energy companies to bounce around at while you climb the tech ladder. 

Many other places around the US will not have such a high concentration of wind energy in such as small area, or you will be way out in the middle of nowhere and have nothing to do in your free time.

I cant comment on the job market for techs, but i had a very hard time getting into green energy. like every other company these days, they are looking for those with crazy amounts of XP for entry level jobs. You must find a way to stand out. I applied to so many god dam jobs over a 5 year span and got very few calls.  I had to go make my name in Tech doing business analytics before i ever got a call. But each call that i did have (and didnt get the job), i would follow up with both the HR department and the hiring manager who interviewed me. Ask them how you can become a better candidate, ask them what this job truly entails, ask them if there are other opportunists they would recommend or other companies that might be a better fit. I have found that the people i did talk to were very understanding and also helpful. 

Green energy companies are also looking for people who are really hungry and knowledgeable. I would recommend once you find a company or region to go after, to do crazy amounts of research on both the company and how wind energy companies operate. That is a great way to stand out. I have helped 

Also FYI, a vast majority of wind farms are owned by utilities. these utilities could own a wind range of energy assets such as coal, natural gas, wind, solar, hydro. There are very few companies that are only renewables.

Turbine designers are doing a very good job, turbines produce pretty close to the theoretical maximum energy they can, and costs continue to go down. You can't ask for too much more than that.

All of your suggestions have reasons they a) won't help or b) would cost too much. For instance a fixed pitch turbine would kill your energy yield. And it might not even save cost.

Betz's law indicates the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind, independent of the design of a wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919, by the German physicist Albert Betz. The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized ""actuator disk"" that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind.

931,WikiTextBot,wind,t5_2qyr2,"**Hornsea Wind Farm**

Hornsea Wind Farm is a Round 3 wind farm under construction in the North Sea off the coast of England. 

The wind farm is planned to have a total capacity of up to 6 GW.

The development has been split into a number of subzones. The 1.2 GW Project 1 gained planning consent in 2014; a second 1.8 GW Project 2 was given planning consent in 2016. In 2016 a third subzone was split into two projects Hornsea 3 and 4, with approximate capacities of 1–2 GW and 1 GW, increasing the capacity of the developed project to a maximum of 6 GW.

Construction of the first phase started in January 2018.

These motors usually operate at high rpm and the wind you will find will typically supply a low rpm to your motor. When choosing your motor, aim for one which operates at a similar rpm which you may expect to see (observe others in action). I would most certainly be salvaging an old motor as it will be dirt cheap and won't be horrible if you get the sizing/rpm slightly out of whack 
I would reccomend a generic blade design for your blades.
Lastly I'd reccomend you use your power to charge a battery. If you are using your power directly as you generate it, you encounter other issues such as incompatibility with your device power supply and inconsistency with incoming wind.

976,kenn0223,wind,t5_2qyr2,"This is generally bogus (at least when applied to the US). Most of the items the author claims decrease the value of a wind investment are either 1) already captured in a typical financial model (e.g. increasing O&amp;M costs over time) or 2) are contracted in a manner that fully or partially hedges the exposure to the project (e.g. energy prices).

This sort of analysis must include are review of actual wind investments by real investors to determine if risks are being appropriately captured in investment decision making. Given the nearly 2 decades and $1T+ of investment by mainstream institutional investors I’d say the risks are pretty well understood. 

The combination of the assumptions for CapEx, power prices, and capacity factor don’t line up. Again, in the US, new build wind is more like $1600/kW; the current generation of WTGs are averaging a 38% capacity factor, and contracts are being signed for $20-40/MWh (plus $30/MWh of PTC for yrs 1-10).   The author clearly does not understand that few projects are exposed to the “wholesale” price he references but rather are contracted (at least for an initial period of time). So to make his logic work you have to use the most current CapEx and NCFs and compare them to what buyers are contracting at and factor the PTC to get the overall revenue numbers. 

Next, he tries to add an additional $2/kW/km to the CapEx for 100 km of new HVDC transmission. First of, no one build HVDC to connect a wind farm any connection required would be built using traditional AC transmission design. Secondly, this does not match reality where nearly all wind projects use the existing capacity in bulk transmission system. Generally the only transmission costs are a few miles to get from the wind project to the existing system and the cost to build/improve a switchyard to connect the project. In some areas additional network upgrades are required but they rarely add anywhere close to $200/kW.  Furthermore, in the US, even the highest voltages (230 and 345kV) only cost about $500k/mi to build. So for a 200MW wind project (typical for the US) the actual value is more like $1.50/kW/km for a much shorter distance.

He goes on to argue that increased renewable penetration has an intervention cost and, while this intuitively sounds plausible, it has not materialized in any of the major US markets even as wind penetration reaches 5%+ of capacity and, at times 50%+ of energy. The only balancing authority that has taken any action related to wind integration costs is Bonneville Power Authority (BPA) who has claimed unique costs associated with balancing their  hydro system with wind. The variability in the resource is managed successfully by all of the US grid operators primarily by forecasts and scheduling of the entire generation stack and to a lesser extent by the use of flexible resources such as natural gas and, increasingly, batteries. Numerous studies have shown the most of the major RTOs can handle renewable penetration of 50% or more without significant reliability issues. 

Finally; he hangs his hat of a return target of 8% which, in my experience is higher than most projects target. Usually the project level returns are closer to 7% with sponsor returns in the 8-10% range depending on debt and tax equity structuring.

But check it out:

1. It cost me $4500 after grants and such. In 2013 when I went I think total tuition was around $14-15K. I had my tuition paid off in 6 months.

2. I got hired as a wind tech starting at around $25/H. Only about 1/5 of the people in my class had jobs at graduation but most had jobs within a few months either in wind or telecom. (I would advise against telecom)

3. Almost all of the other people I worked with got 2 year A.S. degrees (from other for profit schools) and were paying off $30-50k in student loans! Let me tell you, these guys did NOT have a leg up on anyone education wise. You learn 95% of the job on the job. Not once did another entry level tech teach me something I hadn't also learned from my tech school.

4. I moved up the ranks quickly, first promotion in 4 months second promotion in 1 year. After 3.5 years as a tech, I now make as much money as a mid level engineer working as an SME at a corporate office. Almost all of the guys with degrees are still out being wind techs (nothing wrong with that, I actually really miss it).

Down side is that I am not an engineer and don't have a degree so I can't really leave the company (don't want to) or I may have to be an entry level tech again. I am however using employer assisted tuition reimbursement to get a degree.

This is just my story, YMMV. The point is that if you want to be a wind tech AND do well in the industry, just get your foot in the door and don't be a piece of shit (work hard, try to learn as much as you can and be cool with people).

You can look at the papers of the people who works in MES department, which is the department of measurements. Usually when someone publishes a paper, they also attach the related data through doi to the papers as well.  

The answer to the variance of the wind speed is mostly dependent on your terrain and atmospheric stability. As it was mentioned, if you have a flat terrain, your flow would be more uniform but if you have a terrain with many obstacles or hills etc, then, you would get much more complex and turbulent flow. The variance in the wind speed is defined as turbulence intensity(TI) and it is the ratio between the standard deviation of the wind speed and the mean wind speed for a given time period. TI is mostly calculated for 10 minutes from high frequency data(10+ Hz). 

If you are just looking for numbers, you can use TI= 0.12 for low turbulence and TI=0.16 for high turbulence. You can use IEC 61400-3 standards as a reference to these numbers. 

If you want to create the flow based on an initial wind speed and TI, you can look at Mann Turbulence Model developed by Jokab Mann of DTU Wind and is almost the standard way of creating the turbulence box. ",1544828143.0

&amp;#x200B;

First: the power of a wind turbine is a fraction of the power in the wind and that fraction is less than 1. Obvious, I know, but it means the logical first thing to do is figure out the power in the wind. Depends on the size of the turbine, the density of the air and the windspeed: P = 1/2 A (rho) V\^3. Power in watts, area in square meters, rho in kg/m\^3 (you can use about 1.2 kg/m\^3 for air density, it doesn't change much and you don't have to be that close) and V in m/s . 

&amp;#x200B;

At the precise second I'm writing this Heathrow has 3 mph winds- let's make it 10 mph, which is 4.4 m/s, make it interesting. They don't give blade diameters on the model you mentioned but I'm going to guess 2 meter diameter, so about 3 square meters of ""blade disk.""  
1/2 (3 m\^2)(1.2 kg/m\^2)(4.4 m/s)\^3 is, doing math in public, about 153 watts. With 3 mph winds (1.5 m/s) that number becomes 6 (six) watts. That is what ""velocity cubed"" does to your power. Half the speed, 1/8 the power. One third the speed, 1/27 the power.  


Second, that's the windspeed at Heathrow's tower, probably 20 meters off the ground. Lower down, with buildings and cars and whatnot upwind, you get a LOT less wind. Heathrow has huge empty runways. There are rough calculations you can do, but basically you're going to get much less wind than the weather station does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, efficiency. The Betz efficiency, you can't ever do better and you can't reach it, is around 63%. 153 watts becomes 96 watts. Utility scale million dollar three blade turbines are around 40%. Rooftop turbines ... well, nobody's ever going to replace one or recommend one to their friends because of points 1 and 2, why bother making them any good?

reg. profile: the profile for a wind turbine blade determines at what angle of attack it provides the highest lift, and at what angle the lift divided by the drag is highest. I don't know how sophisticated you'll want to make this, but try googling for open source turbine profiles. Well known ones are from the DTU and NACA series. Thicker profiles are usually more forgiving wrt stall and pitch angles, so don't use too thin profiles I'd say for a small experiment. 
As for the pitch: the pitch can be used to give the profile a relative angle wrt to the airflow, but this is pretty dependent on the (rotational)speed of the blade. Probably good to do a little trial and error here by testing your setup for a large variation of pitch angle.
Wrt number of blades: more blades = more torque, but more drag, but don;t forget about structural difficulties, so I'd suggest 3 or 4 as a compromise. with 2 the stability is a bit harder to control since the rotor has different properties in 2 directions, with 3 or more, the balance is better. 5 is pretty complex to manufacture, so in the industry 3 is seen as the best compromise.

Some additions to Joeren\_B's comments. As he mentioned, there are plenty of airfoils that can be used for blade design. You can look up DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine (uses FFA-W3-xxx airfoils) or NREL 5MW reference wind turbine (uses combination of DU and NACA airfoils). Assuming that you do not want to copy the blades of these, because if you did, direct downscaling most probably won't work. What you want to do is that using that airfoils, you need to be able to generate some torque, which you can calculate by using a steady-BEM (blade element momentum) code. 

Writing a BEM can be time consuming depending on your familiarity, but it would allow you to optimize your blade design in the most basic manner.

As a source, you can use the following  [book](https://books.google.dk/books/about/Aerodynamics_of_Wind_Turbines.html?id=LcblCAAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y).

It would take most of their GDP and almost every construction company and factory to focus on it—think WWII style nationalization.

A more reasonable approach is to build nukes to replace coal plants as they age and use wind and solar to keep up with demand.

1116,Stay_Curious85,wind,t5_2qyr2,"If I understand you properly there are a few things 

1) if your blades are only attaching 90 degrees apart you will have a rotor unbalance. Especially with the braking you're going to be adding (see below)

2) you're actually going to be increasing your drag on the blades. You have a wind vector coming across the blades from its rotation as well. Its not just the vector of wind that is blowing into the turbine. As the blade rotates around, you will be putting the blade 90 degrees into this wind. This will cause an aerodynamic braking and slow your blades. Not to mention the turbulence

  Imagine rotating your hand while it's out the car window. You're pitching your blades like you're moving your had perpendicular to the road. 

You actually want your blades generating lift so they reduce some of the strain from the incoming wind vector.

3) you're adding a very expensive maintenance item

4) modern 3 bladed turbines pitch the blades with hydraulic rams.  The blade itself can bend to accommodate loading but it has little to do with its ability to catch wind itself.  Turbines will rotate the blades at the root of the blade to get the best angle of attack to generate the most power they can according to their speed curves. 

They do this without the issues pointed out above. The pitch system still needs lubrication and some maintenance but it's not running the length of the blade.

1122,CharlieBra7o,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Okay, I get it now. It looks to me that Braun Windturbines is the only company / one of very few companies that do this. The ""conventional"" way is to use airfoils that stall in a way that above the rated wind u_r speed the power coefficient c_P reduces in a fashion the power output stays almost constant (reduces slightly). This is easier and should result in less load - although this is most likely insignificant for such small turbines.

Anyway, I found a PDF that quickly explains how they do it: http://www.aerocraft.de/downloads/AeroCraft-Systems_gb.pdf

Page 3 states: ""With the models AC 120 and AC 240, the storm safety system guarantees that it can withstand
speeds of up to 40 m/s, thanks to a “helicopter” mechanism. When the wind speed reaches 15–25
m/s, the rotor head tilts progressively and the output is reduced. This is achieved by a hinge which
connects the generator and the support frame and pushes the rotor head into the helicopter position.
The models AC 502, AC 752 and AC 1002 are fitted with an eclipse control system for storm survival:
when the wind speed reaches approx. 15 m/s, the rotor head is progressively turned out of the wind
by a hinge connecting the generator and the wind vane.""

1133,Mighty_Smiter,wind,t5_2qyr2,"This is a great point. While I do not work in Wind, I am in the renewable sector of the utility space(solar). If you want to be someone who works in the field, I highly suggest getting a taste of what you're working with first before investing so much time into an online degree just to find out you do not like the profession. 

I went to a community college and earned an associate's degree. To make a long story short, the director of the program I graduated from helped me get my foot in the door with my first solar company during my second year - then, after two years( and A LOT of hard work) I landed a dream job with an industry giant. 

Learning hands-on and climbing the ranks was the key to getting to the point where I am now. There was a lot of sweat, a little blood, and I may have even wanted to cry a time or two, but MAN was it worth it. There just simply is no way I could ever learned as much as I have by reading text and watching videos. 

So, yeah, I know this doesn't answer the question you asked, but it's what I wish someone would have told me before I started this journey. If you live in an area with wind farms, just go ahead and try to get an entry level job with one of the companies in your area. Now this may mean that you have to start out working for a temp agency doing construction, but if you do good work and are willing to learn(looks like you're poised for a good start), you'll get picked up by a company quickly... You'll start adding experience to your resume, which is really what employers want to see, and while you work you can take basic electrical/hydraulics programs from pretty much any community college I'd assume. Technology is constantly improving/changing, so understanding the basics is much more important than understanding wind specific stuff when it comes to basic education, in my opinion. 

If you want to go into engineering, I'd repeat everything I just said. Get in the field and learn what you're dealing with while you're going to school. This will put you leaps and bounds ahead of other engineers trying to enter the wind industry. 

Lastly, don't forget how big the energy industry is. From legal to finance to logistics to marketing etc. You never know, life may take you to an area with terrible wind resources - will you be capable of transitioning to other industries, or are you going to be so specialized that you have to ""start over"" if you can't stay in wind?

Two pieces of advice that I fully attribute to getting a job in wind -

1. Keep applying! What ended up getting me a call-back was applying for a stationary position at a wind farm in TX, which I applied for offhandedly. I had already applied to be a traveling tech w/ the same company a month or so prior and the first question the recruiter asked me was if I would be willing to be a traveling tech as opposed to stationary. Simply applying for the job I didn't really want put me on the radar and I ended up being offered the position that I had applied for in the first place!
2. Know electricity! I did not go to wind school and do not have a background in electrical work, and I was very caught off guard when my interview consisted of an hour and a half interrogation about electrical theory and application. An engineering degree and two years in industrial construction did not prepare me for what I would consider the most stressful interview of my life. In the end though, I must have done well enough because my interviewer said that I at least had an elementary understanding of electrical theory which they could work with. Since then I've watched hundreds of youtube videos on electricity and its applications which has helped with my understanding immensely.

I think you need certain certificates to become a technician. I'm more looking into project development or working with Wasp and Windographer.,1560618101.0
1159,o_g,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Turbine Techs are in high demand right now, and demand will only get higher. Most companies will train you in tower safety/certification. For these positions, look at NextEra, EDF, RES, GE, Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, etc. 

There is also high demand for field engineers at construction companies. Those positions are a lot of travel and field work, but pay relatively well. For a position like this, look at the big construction companies like Mortenson, Wanzek, Blattner, RES, IEA, Black and Macdonald, Fagen, Boldt, Henkels-McCoy, etc. 

Development will be a bit harder nut to crack. You can try to big shops like EDF, EDPR, RES, Nextera, Avangrid, Sempra, and others. 

If you like working with Wasp and Windographer, you would be looking at a job in Resource Analysis. This is also a tough field to get into, as for a lot of these jobs you’ll be competing with meteorology PHDs, or software engineers/data scientists. But if that’s the route you want to go you can always look at UL-AWSTruepower, WindLogics (NextEra), Natural Power, or DNV-GL

Keep in mind that these lists are not exhaustive and there are a ton of smaller companies doing the same work as the companies mentioned above (development especially).

1161,Mijal,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt; I live in the Dallas area and prefer to stay here 

I can tell you from recent personal experience that this is likely to be a problem. Turbine techs are in high demand, but you obviously have to travel to the farm to do the job. For development or resource analysis, most companies will have their people in specific offices in one or two places in the country (per company)--there's just no reason to spread those people out geographically, and a lot of reasons to have them together where they can collaborate more easily. The good news is that they typically include relocation assistance. There are probably some more of the smaller independent contractor shops that farm out work to people working out of their homes, but that can be a more difficult group to get in touch with and the work can be inconsistent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mid-career in wind resource analysis (and some related work), and when I was job hunting in 2016-2017 the only interview I got near my home in Dallas was at Leeward Energy, so you could see if they're hiring (they didn't end up hiring anyone from the interview, and I hear they've gone through some staffing changes/reductions since). Otherwise, you're looking at places like Juno Beach, Florida (NextEra/WindLogics), Albany area of New York (UL Renewables and GE), Seattle, WA (DNV GL), California (multiple), Chicago, IL (Acciona Energy US), etc. For the rest of Texas, I think DNV GL might still have an office in Austin and EDPR has main offices in Houston.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I moved to Alabama for a job with Southern Power (my opinions in this post are my own and are not official statements of Southern Power or Southern Company). Moving away from family was hard, but it's definitely been a great thing over all. My other personal advice (besides apply a lot) would be to run any salary discussions through a cost of living calculator--salaries for California, especially, can look awesome until you realize what you'll actually be able to buy with it (Dallas is cheaper to live in than a lot of places).

2. The program at Lethbridge is great. It gives you lots of skills and general knowledge to start with, as well as a lot a lot a lot of rescue training and knowledge which is good for your confidence when you do start a job.
I found the electrical to be too in-depth, but better to know too much. The basic maintenance and operation knowledge is useful though.
The issue that stems from those courses is mostly personality based, in that some guys come out of it thinking that they’re too good to do the routine maintenance and cleaning. So don’t be like that and it’ll be easy.
(I did the course it 2013 so it may be quite different now)
Even if you just do the first half, it might be beneficial depending on your background.

3. My favourite parts of the job:
- when you leave the shop, you’re not under direct supervision and you’re just expected to get the job done
- heavy lifts with cranes
- occasional travel to interesting areas (I’ve been to Vancouver Island, Nova Scotia, Kansas, and a few others)
- a lot of the time you don’t have the exact right parts or tools so just have to make it work, and figure out solutions. Gotta love a good puzzle.

Biggest draw back is definitely pay. You can work your way up if you work hard, but don’t expect more than $25/hour starting unfortunately. Hard for those of us who came from Oil and Gas... 

4. Natural career progression is a tough one. A lot depends on if you’re willing to move. A lot of established sites become stagnant since the senior guys get to the upper positions and stay there, whereas if you’re okay moving to say, Tumbler Ridge, you could move up fast since most people don’t want to be there.

The best soaring birds can only manage around 20:1 lift to drag ratio, while manmade gliders can exceed 60:1.

Generally, we have power-purchase agreements to deliver power to a specific customer (i.e. high-energy consumer, like a data center, mining company, etc.) who for whatever reason wants to buy renewable power. We also have PPA's with energy utilities.

These agreements can be up to 30 years. However, the wind doesn't always blow nor the sun shine, so if we are unable to produce what is agreed to, we are required to essentially purchase renewable power on the open market to fulfill our 'generation' requirements. This can be said in the exact opposite side of things too. Sometimes we produce 'too much' power, in that, it exceeds our PPA, so then we can sell this power on the open market, as well. Regardless, it's hard to predict one-way or another. 

Power purchase agreements give companies like ours certainty on a fixed price for the power produce. At the same token, it gives our customers certainty, as well. 

We're required to do so, because some U.S. states or government entities mandate a certain amount of power be renewable. Often you'll see these called 'renewable portfolio standards' -or- RPS. 

Utilities, and sometimes specific companies are held to meet the RPS and if they fall out of compliance, they are essentially fined for not complying. This can be problematic if an energy company, like the one I work for, has established a PPA.

If renewable companies don't produce the power they agree to, they're forced to go to an open market and purchase renewable power. Renewable companies also produce more power than their power-purchase agreements and can sell the excess power on the open market.",1562436541.0

I don’t know what the situation in Texas is, but they may have less issues with this. 
The problem is if you put very big rotors on short towers, you start getting what DNVGL call blockage effects, in which there is actually less generation that what the hub-height wind speed tells you. The blades are also subject to higher wind shear, which increases the fatigue loading.

Electricity is sold on a wholesale market in hourly auctions. Usually it doesn’t matter how the electricity generated.

A VAWT in a low-speed environment won't teach you much about turbines at all. They repeatedly fail. It's important to understand why, but building one is a very inefficient way to learn. Start with the basic physics. E= ½mv^(2)  : (units here are Joules, kg, and m/s) that's the kinetic energy of a moving mass. Now work out how much volume of air moves through your wind turbine at slow speed (say 4 m/s), in one second. Then take the density of air, to work out its mass. Now you can work out its kinetic energy, in one second - i.e. its power. Now think about when one half of the VAWT is moving *with* the wind: how is the other half moving?

If you want to learn about turbines, first play with Kerbal Space Program, building planes instead of rockets. That will teach you quite a bit about lift and aerofoils. Seriously. It will.

1258,Tripsel2,wind,t5_2qyr2,"This is kinda rude. OP just wanted some help not criticism. In addition it's not totally true, especially the part about upwind and downwind moving parts. A HAWT has neither and that works!

The reason it's hard to make a VAWT at home is the blades. They have to be very cleverly designed to generate lift with all kinds of angles of attack. 

The basic power equation is:

P = ½ Cp ρ A v³

ρ is air density
A is area of the turbine viewed in the direction of the wind
Cp is the power coefficient which would be about 0.1 for a homemade VAWT

So if your turbine is about 1 meter high and wide and the wind speed is 4 m/s you'll make less than 4 Watts.",1568218213.0
1259,rsta223,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;  Now think about when one half of the VAWT is moving with the wind: how is the other half moving?

This isn't the problem with VAWTs. The problem is more the fact that they are more difficult to precisely control, they require more material to build for a given power, and are structurally difficult to scale up to large size economically (especially the massive cantilevered bearing on which they spin). They also don't achieve quite as high of an efficiency as HAWTs.",1568234208.0

&gt; The reason it's hard to make a VAWT at home is the blades. They have to be very cleverly designed to generate lift with all kinds of angles of attack. 

Most VAWTs use relatively simple, symmetrical airfoils. You don't need anything particularly fancy to make one work. The biggest key is that you just need something that has a pretty good L/D ratio. During operation, the blades should be spinning fast enough to not really see too large of a variance in angle of attack anyways - you certainly don't want them stalling.",1568234328.0
1261,Tripsel2,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Interesting I didn't know symmetric airfoils work. I was thinking back to a CFD poster I saw at a conference about some smart curved design. Still, even if the Cp is 0.2 it's still only around 7 Watts, which isn't enough to light a bedroom.",1568235183.0
1262,rsta223,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Yeah - it's really unintuitive, but if you draw it out, you'll see you can actually generate positive torque all the way around at every point in the revolution with a symmetric airfoil, as long as you have a sufficiently high L/D and speed ratio. 

Also, I agree that the Cp is going to be really low on a homemade design. I take issue with the assumption of 4m/s. Maybe I edited my last post too late for you to catch if with this reply, but even commercial wind turbines are only making a couple percent of rated power at that wind speed. You really won't make significant power until 6m/s minimum, and usually turbines are designed for full power at 10-13.",1568235550.0
1263,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Start with [Betz's Law](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=betz%27s+law&amp;t=canonical&amp;ia=web) to get a feel for 'swept area' and wind speed on the power produced.

Add that to the fact that the Private Equity and Pension Fund markets are very underdeveloped, and they can’t really monetise these assets. So they’ve just expanded that to other markets and so do the whole cycle, from development to asset management. 

However, there are relatively few of these, and they are usually semi-government owned utilities (think Enel, Dong Energy, Acciona). Most every other market has a fairly separate sector of pure-play developers, and long term asset holders.

To understand why wind power is resisted more and more, learn about all the Germans fed up with industrial skylines and infrasound where there used to be pastoral countryside.

Usually these contracts are designed to make them hard to break/void by the landowners and with good reason, the wind farm has a lot more to lose if the contract is voided (the landowners keep their land, the farm loses the project, and sometimes a single landowner getting out could require substantial changes to the project), but at least there ought to be a way for you to get out if after a couple years of operation you're not getting paid. 

Also ask about the payment scheme. There are usually two different payment schemes: One is a percentage of the wind farm earnings, and another is a fixed payment depending on land occupation. Or (my personal favorite) a mix of both: A fixed payment that guarantees that you will always receive something, plus a percentage of the wind farm earnings if they outperform the fixed payment.

1329,fluxlinkages,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Here are some responses to your concerns, but by all means feel free to quiz the developer:

* Who maintains the access roads?
   * Assuming your concern is during operation of the project (read as post-construction), the Owner. If a Landowner has an access-road on their property, the Owner will maintain the access road as a necessity of operations (i.e. if it washes out, if they bring in heavy machinery and disturb it, etc.). In the off chance the Landowner disturbs the road, I would assume there would be a lease term that would obligate the Landowner to repair the road.
*  How will repairs and maintenance affect the land around the turbine? 
   * In most cases, the access are around the turbine is what is needed to support normal operations and maintenance. In unique cases where heavy machinery is required to repair a major component, the Owner would not only compensate for any crop damage, but would restore the area at the turbine base to the original condition.
* Can we still use them if the company paying to put them up goes bankrupt?
   * I understand the concern, but the probability is incredibly low, and even if this were to occur, a new Operator would purchase the assets of the original Owner and the same lease agreements would be assigned to the new Operator.
*  If the company does go bankrupt, how much does it cost to take one down and who pays for that? 
   * Some of this is addressed in the prior response. The lease would be assigned and remain valid in the event of a change of ownership. Like a new car lease, there is a lease term. There are terms for restoration in the lease in the event of decommissioning (removal) of the project. The Owner may approach the Landowner with an option to extend the lease. Consult the Developer about decommissioning. 
*  Can they function properly in -40 degrees (Wisconsin weather) 
   * All turbines have an operating window of ambient temperature, measured at hub height, where all systems function normally. There is a wider window of extreme temperatures where the turbine will shut down for self-preservation. -40C is typically on the lower end of most turbine extreme temperature windows. One of the posts noted cold-weather packages fairly accurately.
*  Does anyone know any other questions that I should ask so we can avoid being screwed over? 
   * Ask what comes to mind and don't be shy about it. But what I will say is keeping an open mind is paramount. There is a lot of anti-wind propaganda as you are seemingly aware of. In the end, they're not out to screw Landowners over, as they're (you are) a critical element to the success of any project.",1572965089.0

1: Are you completely honest and come clean when you fuck something up? (because you will, and trying to hide it will only make the problem worse and wind up getting you fired)

2:Not afraid of long days and physically exhausting work? Being frozen in the winter and sweating bullets in the summer? My last week was around 70 hours. That’s low in some places.

3:Safety conscious and willing to stand up for yourself and others to remain safe when someone tries to cut corners to get the job done?

You said ""from wind turbines to coal mines, oil wells, and other existing environmental impacts."" I'm going to say ""From aesthetics to actual human deaths and misery. "" 

Because wind was a bit under 1% of US electricity in 2007 and a bit under 7% in 2018 (  [citation](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/) ). And total electricity usage was, within the noise, constant during that time.   
Presumably, then, that 6% of market share came from coal.    


Coal isn't an ""existing environmental impact"" that stays constant. I happen to know the number in 2012 and it was 110 MILLION tons of coal ash. For that one year. It's all sorts of new environmental impact. It's mercury and fine particles in the air, it's radon, it's  [arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, lithium, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, thallium and uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coal_ash) .

And, because of wind,  six percentage points of that has gone away. So my primary concern would be, what was that quote from the last link, '  tens of thousands of cases of “exacerbated asthma” and other respiratory illnesses each year. '",1576193542.0

I mean, Nebraska's wind turbines look like  [this](http://gregladen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Nebraska-Wind-Farm.jpg) , and if you're not looking at a wind farm you're seeing fifty miles of uninterrupted corn.

People get WEIRD about the aesthetics of renewables.  [Paywall](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/science/earth/28solar.html) \- that's a 2011 complaint that New Jersey telephone poles are ugly now.

Including the phrase ""  And the Bishops, who farm in Iowa County, still carry debt from when hog prices tanked in the 1990s. ""

Capacity factor and transmission loses. 

Wind doesn’t blow all the time, so the installed capacity will never operate at full power every hour of the day. Anywhere from a 30-40% capacity factor for onshore is good. For offshore, it’s between ~50-60%. So divide your math by 1/3. 

That energy produced is usually in a rural setting, away from high demand (commercial buildings, industrials, residences, etc). You have to transport that energy from say Iowa to Chicago, for example. There are losers associated with move that energy from the WTG, to the step up transformer, through the collection system, going to the substation, getting stepped up again, and then it’s “on the grid”. 

And has to get sent several hundred miles away to where the demand for the electricity exists. 
Could be anywhere from a 20-80% reduction depending on how far, what lines, etc. 

As a side note, this is why offshore is so appealing. Even though it is more expensive than onshore, it is located relatively close to demand centers (Boston, NYC, Philly, DC, VA, NC, the entire east coast). Less losses, higher capacity factor, and an enormous market.",1576770936.0

Yeah, natural scenery is such a silly thing. Those foolish NIMBYs and all.

Let me remind all fans of Big Wind that environmentalists are people who try to protect nature from ALL human impacts. They don't cherry-pick which ones are OK based on ""green"" labels, or lack of smoke rising from structures (except when nacelles burn).

Working in the industry blinds you to the downsides of this highly visible, invasive technology, just as frackers chase paychecks and don't care much about the road scars and water contamination.

Wind farms don't go up where there's scenery. They go up where there's nothing around for 100 miles so the wind is uninterrupted. It's simply not profitable to put them in places that most humans go to sight see.

Now you're comparing the wind industry to the environmental impacts of fracking? Talk about apples to oranges.

&gt; as are bird, bat &amp; insect deaths

Which is why any wind farm near migration routes or protected lands undergoes continuous environmental impact monitoring and scientific studies to mitigate this hazard. Turbines on my site are shut down at specific times during the day when these animals are most active during parts of the season when they're migrating through. We also have independent agencies inspect our sites regularly for dead or injured animals, and there's a mandatory reporting regulation that fines us if we don't report dead birds/bats on our site. I found a dead bat *once*, but when I reported it it turned out to be a bat that that agency had placed there deliberately to see if we were doing our jobs.",1576810783.0
1380,FiniteEarth,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I'll reply to this particular post to cover the same elements in others. I know this is futile, like trying to say AGW is real at a Trump rally. Wind workers who post here have their favorite industry and gravy train to defend, just like other tribal humans.

You folks are excusing HUGE new physical impacts that are easily visible to millions of people, and kill a lot more birds and bats than industry workers will be able to count (even without disincentives). So, you have to pretend these new impacts somehow don't matter. I just wish you'd stop claiming to be environmentalists on all but a superficial level. Look at the huge Texas wind industry, spawned by the same lack of regulation that's allowed so many oil and gas scars. Those industries share a large labor pool in trucking and crane work. They're ""green"" one day and ""brown"" another, and paychecks are their main concern.

Coal represents longstanding environmental damage, regardless of whether it's growing (which I'm certainly aware of). To claim or imply that wind power isn't ADDING to existing damage defies all logic. From a purely aesthetic viewpoint (non-trivial) far more people see wind projects than will ever see coal mines without aerial surveys. The prominent nature of wind turbines assures high visibility and many more are slated for construction, so it will only get worse.

Coal mines are often hidden at or below ground level, with Wyoming being a good example. Appalachian-style coal mines are hard to see (except from the air) until you're relatively close, due to other mountains hiding them (easily provable w/Street View maps), whereas wind turbines are put directly on top of mountains, with flashing lights as well. And they're put just about everywhere else the wind blows (or barely blows; see videos posted by ""Ocotillo Wind Turbine Destruction"" and similar activists).

You speak of mountaintop removal yet continually ignore wind projects clear-cutting miles of ridge-line, and when forced on the topic you claim they're ""beautiful."" A coal shill could claim they like the look of strip mines, as when Ted Nugent performed at the Holden 22 mine site in 2009. You see the same thing when a new wind ""farm"" opens with grinning engineers observing a mountain spiked with hundreds of giant towers. Eco-hypocrisy, minus a little smoke.

One must constantly dodge physical evidence to defend Big Wind, just like global warning deniers switch from ""CO2 helps plants"" back to ""CO2 isn't really causing warming."" You can never simply admit that Big Wind is Big Sprawl and many find it ugly, just as they despise coal mine scars. I was against Big Coal and logging long before Big Wind took the top spot in scenery-trashing. It's all the same big machine to me.

Many claim that wind turbines are somehow divorcing us from fossil fuels, but a single blade semi-truck trip or manufacturing plant tour debunks that. Energy density and portability is vital to manufacturing anything that big. You can't get it at real-world scale from batteries except in sci-fi scenarios.

As for wildlife impacts, the ""house cats kill more birds"" thing lacks major context of species and locations. As with scenery losses, wind power causes additive deaths, not true mitigation. Cats don't kill bats, either, and short of swatting random dragonflies, they aren't splattering insects like wind turbines do.

None of the above adds up to a technology that can rightfully be called ""green"" except in the narrow context that trying to solve AGW is green (I see it as society scrambling to keep growing by any means). With over a third of a million wind turbines on the planet and CO2 still rising, I wouldn't bet on more of them making much difference, considering all the carbon needed to build them.

&gt; Called the &amp;quot;20% Wind Scenario,&amp;quot; the NREL report noted that generating 20% of U.S. electricity from wind could eliminate approximately 825 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the electrical energy sector in 2030.

&gt; In high-density arrays of large wind turbines, the researchers examined possible declines in systemwide efficiency associated with a phenomenon called &amp;quot;Wind turbine wakes,&amp;quot; where the wind speed is slowed by extraction of momentum by wind turbines.

&gt; &amp;quot;The &amp;#039;theft&amp;#039; of wind by upstream wind turbines reduces the overall power produced by the total ensemble of wind turbines and the enhanced mixing can alter local climate conditions close to wind turbines,&amp;quot; said Barthelmie.

&gt; Wind is now the top renewable source of electricity generation in the country, a position previously held by hydroelectricity.

&gt; Annual wind generation totaled 300 million megawatthours in 2019, exceeding hydroelectric generation by 26 million MWh. Wind generation has increased steadily during the past decade, in part, because the Production Tax Credit, which drove wind capacity additions, was extended.

&gt; Although total installed wind capacity surpassed total installed hydroelectric capacity in 2016, it wasn&amp;#039;t until 2019 that wind generation surpassed hydroelectric generation.

1/ It would be easy to 3D print, so when it does come to building it, you would have all the pieces micro-engineered in advance. At least using 3D test runs you can get efficiencly measurements. 

2/ I hoped that it can be more efficient than other VAWTs which are not efficient. then I found a vawt with adaptive blades after designing that, where all 4 vawt blades are in optimum alignment. You know when you have your hand out of the car window, you can either shape it like an airfoil and use lift, or you can put it flat and use drag.

Wind of 5m/s (11mph) with a 2 meter turbine (1 meter radius) can generate about 100 watts.  Double the wind speed to 10m/s, and you get close to 800 watts.  At 30 meters above ground, only about 1% of the USA gets 10m/s of wind.  Industrial wind mills get the hub 300 feet up and have huge blades, and generate power where residential wind is useless.

Problem with this is that it is really hard to make the trade-off between future energy production and scheduled maintenance. Is it beneficial to defer this non-critical maintenance to a later moment when there is less wind and therefore less production loss? What is the value of doing the maintenance now vs in 5 days?

1644,sevykep,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Adding some detail: If you are working on optimizing your rotor geometry, you are probably interested in measuring your power coefficient. This is the power produced divided by the power in the wind incident on the rotor, or Power/(0.5 \* air density \* wind speed\^3 \* swept area of rotor). Here ""Power"" can be the electrical power output if you are working on the efficiency of your whole system, or the mechanical power (rotor  torque \* rotation rate) if you are working on the optimizing just the rotor aerodynamics right now. As the wind speed is cubed, it is important to put a lot of effort into your wind speed measurement (as any error also gets cubed). 

The power coefficient (Cp) is plotted as a function of tip-speed ratio, which is the rotation rate \* turbine radius / wind speed. Cycling through rotation rates with a fairly constant wind speed will give you a nice Cp curve. The peak of this curve is your turbine's peak efficiency. 

The IEC standard mentioned above is concerned with the power curve, which takes into account both the system efficiency (Cp) and the effect of turbine controls (and some other details). I'd start worrying about the power curve after your rotor geometry is finalized and you are working on your control system/strategy.

&gt;  
&gt;“What  you need is storage. Right now, what’s getting done is a lot of  lithium-ion storage, and that’s because what the California grid needs  right now is short-duration storage of a few hours,” Browning said. “But  as you continue to decarbonize, and you continue to drop more natural  gas off of your grid, you start to need longer-duration storage. You  know, you need the storage that’s going to be able to store electricity  for days, or weeks, or months, or years. And when you get into those  kinds of longer-duration storage, lithium-ion just gets prohibitively  expensive. And so, that’s where hydrogen comes in.”

Rather  than curtailing output, the excess power could be used to produce  hydrogen through electrolysis, for example, with the hydrogen stored for  later use.

It’s going from 80% to 100% renewable energy that’s challenging. We are very far off from that atm. So it’s good to keep storage in mind and be preparing for this moment for area where you live. We just don’t want it to distract or prevent/discourage the start to shift towards 80% renewable energy.

A lot of engineers are working on the storage problem. But more would always be helpful!

This is why grid energy storage is so important. We need to figure out a way to store energy, possibly for months or even years, and deliver it when it is needed, often to a long distance away. All attempts to solve this problem with batteries, or things like pumped hydro, quickly run into impossible limits. Those ideas simply don't store enough energy. You need a way to store vast amounts of energy in a dense form, at a density comparable to fossil fuels.

&gt; ""New nuclear power plants cost 2.3 to 7.4times those of onshore wind or utility solar PVper kWh, take 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation, and produce 9 to 37 times the emissions per kWh as wind.

As such, a fixed amount of money spent on a new nuclear plant means much less power generation, a much longer wait for power, and a much greater emission rate than the same money spent on WWS technologies.

There  is  no  such  thing  as  a  zero-or  close-to-zero emission  nuclear  power  plant.  Even  existing  plants  emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. However, all plants also emit 4.4 g-CO2e/kWh from the water vapor and heat they release. This contrasts with solar panels and wind turbines, which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the air by about 2.2 g-CO2e/kWh for a net difference from this factor alone of 6.6 g-CO2e/kWh.

On top of that, because all nuclear reactors take 10-19 years or more between planning and operation vs.2-5 year for utility solar or wind, nuclear causes another64-102 g-CO2/kWh over 100 years to be emitted from the background grid while consumers wait for it to come online or be refurbished, relative to wind or solar.

Overall, emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178 g-CO2/kWh, not close to 0.

China’s  investment  in  nuclear plants  that  take  so  long  between  planning  and  operation instead  of  wind or solar resulted in China’s CO2emissions increasing 1.3 percent from 2016 to 2017 rather than declining by an estimated average of 3percent.The resulting difference in air pollution emissions may have caused 82,000 additional air pollution deaths in China in 2016 alone, with additional deaths in years prior and since.""",1579091794.0

Batteries, or pumped hydro, or other gravity systems, or compressed air, or flywheels, or methane, or some combination thereof. I just don't think hydrogen will (or should) have a large percentage share of that final mix.

If you’ve done the math, you realize that batteries, flywheels, even pumped hydro, all store energy in a range around 1-10 TWh, even if you go crazy with those ideas. And it’s exceeding expensive too. For instance, even at $50/kWh, batteries will cost between $50-500B just to store that amount. A figure that will have to be rebuilt every decade or so. Pump hydro is cheaper, but then you are limited in how much energy you can store.

You’ve mentioned methane, but failed to explain how you will get that methane without generating GHGs. If it is made via biomass, you’ll be greatly limited in production volumes. If it is synthetic, you’ll need hydrogen, since hydrogen is an input gas for synthetic methane via the Sabatier method. So one of your alternatives *is* a form hydrogen energy storage.

So if your goal is to store something like 100-1000 TWh, necessary for months or years or spare energy, hydrogen becomes a massive winner. You quickly run out of alternative options.

&gt; I don't agree with that. When we are talking about grid storage, energy density is not our main concern. Compressed air systems or even pumped hydro systems are planning to use old mining tunnels, we have plenty of unused space there. For grid storage the main constraints are fast availability and large total storage, nobody cares if it requires double the volume than hydrogen.

At the volumes we are looking, it becomes an issue. Compressed air has something like 1/100 the volume of hydrogen. And since hydrogen is also a compressed gas, you can use the same systems for energy storage. You just get vastly more energy with hydrogen. CAES really doesn’t make sense at the largest scale.

&gt; Sorry, but no. The hydrogen answer is definitely solvable otherwise and you didn't show any answer to the issues with hydrogen. I mean even if you just compare hydrogen against methane.

Look at how SpaceX is planning to make methane on Mars for refueling their spaceships - they made their rocket methalox, because they plan to use Sabatier reaction from water and CO2.

So there must be some reason why they didn't want to use hydrogen, and that reason is the complication with storing H2 long term.

In this case, a permanent magnet pulling on a ball will attract the ball, but it won't stop attracting a ball just because a stronger magnet gets close. Then they will BOTH attract the ball.  The weaker magnet will partially cancel out the pull of the stronger one as their magnetic fields merge and combine. 

And, where did the energy come from to move the stronger magnet into place?  Also, the strength of magnetic pull diminishes based on the square of the distance from the magnet, so a magnet that is half a strong, but closer to the steel ball, will still have a stronger pull on the ball than a magnet that is twice as strong but a distance away. 

But, assuming you do create a ""ramp"" of magnetic potential that pulls steel balls along that ramp, impacting a paddle or lever at the end of the ramp, how do you get the steel balls to exit the ramp, where the magnetic attraction is highest?  Won't the balls just stop moving there and ""stack up?""

Newer autotransformers can help cope with this fluctuation of grid voltage but realistically that just pushes the issue to the substations.

You also have the extra strain on the electricity network from millions of heat pumps, which only achieve a COP of 2-2.5 in the winter when they're in use, and hopefully millions of EVs.

This time, the decline in fossil fuel is no longer cyclical, but secular. Coal is already finished in Western Europe, as UK needed only 6 years to reduce its percentage in power generation from 40% to almost 0 last year. Germany, despite its phasing out of nuclear power and political comprise to lignite producing regions, also saw a steep decline in coal consumption for the last two years. In the US, coal consumption is down 50% since 2007, and despite Trump's rhetoric, its decline actually accelerated during his administration. Every publicly traded US company has gone at least bankrupt once since 2011. Warren Buffett, ever the hardcore capitalist who scorns ESG initiatives, announced last year that his utilities (largest in the US) will shut down almost all coal in western US by 2023.

Crude oil is 70% transportation. As demand and production for EVs soar in EU, China, and US, the decline of oil consumption may be a lot faster than big oil (and EIA, and IEA) expected. Historical crude price actions often show that even a 5% decline in consumption can lead to 50% drop in prices. During recent China shutdown, WTI has already declined by 25%. If US shale producers are already struggling at $50 WTI, how will they fare at $30, or even $20?

------------

Jim Cramer is equating big oil with big tobacco. I actually consider this a bad comparison, because:

- Tobacco is highly addictive and has no alternatives for smokers. The greatest threat facing big oil is not environmentalists, but better alternatives.
- Tobacco industry is highly consolidated and only has a few players, who have basically engaged in a multi decades cartel like behavior of continuing raising prices. Oil industry has thousands of players including sovereign ones, and it's cutthroat competition.
- Tobacco industry requires little capital investment whereas oil industry is very capital intensive.

The hydrogen in your car may not have traveled more than 150 miles from where it was created. No oil tankers, no oil refineries and no endless wars to defend the resource needed. A modern (only just starting to come into use) compressed gas truck can transport close to 1000 kg of hydrogen (at 500 bar in COPV tanks).

[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/business/energy-environment/after-three-decades-federal-tax-credit-for-ethanol-expires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/business/energy-environment/after-three-decades-federal-tax-credit-for-ethanol-expires.html). Sure, states like Iowa still offer some state incentives (like California does for its renewable power or EVs), but that's not an issue a federal candidate has any say in.
2. I know it's just tossing in a TV show quote, but the idea that it takes more energy to make ethanol (due to inputs from growing corn, transport, etc.) has been soundly debunked dozens of times in academic studies. Middle-of-the-road estimates put it at a little more than twice the energy from ethanol as you put into it.
3. I'm in South Dakota, and I never see fracking as a barometer for candidates here.

I'm sure changing the primary order among states would impact ethanol a bit, but one thing Hillary Clinton demonstrated strongly was that any candidates who ignore Midwest farmers do so at their own risk. The electoral system was designed to give voice to less populous areas that nonetheless have valid concerns that don't resonate with the larger electorate.

It might be possible to run the distilleries on solar/wind, but renewable sources for fertilizer and tilling are a long way off. 
Requiring injection of ethanol into gasoline is a defacto subsidy since no one would do it if they could sell the product without it. The mandate forces a cost transfer from raw gas to ethanol.

Lower energy density? That's range anxiety. Its corrosive to old rubber parts, but cars arent made with those anymore. Farming inputs are already calculated into carbon reduction, but with most cellulose sources they are waste materials already grown, so there isnt that farm input.
You're using the same subsidy/mandate argument that people use against EVs. Cars, distribution infrastructure. Hell, a buyback would have to be subsidized. If EV/biofuel is the best way, why does the government need to put a thumb on the scale for any of it? 
As for energy to power the plants, most pilot and larger scales for advanced/cellulosic in place today use the waste product to power the plant AND export excess to the grid. Some reach carbon negative status by offsetting enough fossil electricity on top of the oil offsets.

 What you are implying is that supply from fracking is demand driven from power generation, but this is incorrect.

Gas has been over supplied for several years now, to the point where all these producers are going bankrupt, yet we still see gas production growth year over year, meaning gas just continues to get cheaper. You would think that because it is uneconomic to produce the gas at such low prices, producers would dial it back, but they don’t. 

The point is, all signs point to cheap gas being here to stay. Yes, renewables are the way to go in the future. But somebody has to pay for that. From my job, I know that when utilities are looking to replace their old generators or increase their generation capacity for load growth, cost and reliability are the first two things that are assessed. At $2 gas and new gas plants operating at a 7 heat rate, that’s $14 dollar power/mwh, and O&amp;M is around $10 - so all in $24/mwh. That’s about the same as renewable PPA rates utilities could sign - which are around $25 right now. 

Yes, I know that $24 dollars doesn’t take into account the cost to the climate etc, but the way the market is structured, generally the utility isn’t paying the climate cost so they’re not taking it into account. Looking at comparable variable costs, plus the fact that utilities first responsibility is to maintain grid reliability (plus the fact that a gas plant doesn’t require a lot of new infrastructure), you can’t argue cheap gas is not a headwind to renewables growth.",1581738665.0

And my objection to ethanol isn't range anxiety, it is that the cost equation is negative vs. un-penalized gasoline. Plus, there are many engines that cannot tolerate ethanol, even though cars now can. Additionally you cannot run it in pipelines, it is too corrosive, so it goes by rail or truck in stainless tank cars, which is expensive and dangerous. Rail &amp; roads go through cities which forces emergency services to upgrade in case of  a crash or derailment. Seeing many fire departments upgrade to higher insurance ratings is costly, but external to the sellers of ethanol, born by the locals. I have yet to see any showing that sending oil though the fields to make ethanol for gasoline dilution has even a 0% net energy budget.

Actually they are paying their fair share plus some.  Their capital investment has helped extend the life of the current grid and the utilities did not have to lay any capital out for said investment.

Yes equally so that the poor end up paying more for energy with utility scale.

See again you have it backwards.   Utility scale has NEW connections to the grid that are dedicated to each generation facility.  They are large and complicated and tax the grid and sub stations, often requiring major upgrades.   
residential on the other hand does NOT require any new infrastructure other than a different program on the meter.  No new wires, sub stations, nothing new to maintain for the utility at all.  
As for risk, it is much much more distributed with residential scale.  Loss of a 10kW system is nothing but the loss of a 1MW to 10GW system is huge and difficult to manage.

437,Harry-le-Roy,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"&gt; Why did wind power take 25 years to become the number 1 energy generator?

Part of this is what's known in technology commercialization as the ""technology valley of death"". Someone (a whole lot of someones) research and development a new technology. It's better somehow. It's cheaper, or cheaper in certain ways. People need it. But no one adopts it.

There are lots of reasons for this, which generally revolve around ignorance, fear of the unknown, lack of industry skills, and entrenched political interests. 

Any grid-scale power project requires a lot of knowledge and skills, and requires financing. These projects involve risk, and people don't like a lot of risk in investments, if there's not an associated prospect of high payoff. All of the risks associated with another coal-fired plant are well known. There's also ample experience with implementing them in the labor market. The technology is mature and widespread, so there are lots of economies of scale. And subsidies. Power companies get tax deductions and in some cases tax *credits* for costs of doing business, like transporting coal, washing it, etc. There are also ample government programs to pay the costs of their failures: Superfund (and others) to clean up all kinds of pollution, a black-lung program, a program to deal with abandoned and unsafe mine lands, and so on. Energy finance is risk averse. 

Plus, it's human nature that people get habituated to risks they know and upset about the unknown. A coal slurry pond breaks and dumps thousands of gallons of toxic sludge on a small town, and it hardly makes the news. A wind farm kills a few birds, and everyone loses their minds. Most people have never heard of Donora Township or the Centralia coal fire.

A significant change that pulled the stopper out of wind and solar in the US was the Recovery Act of 2009. An infusion of money for renewable energy *implementation* helped stimulate demand, which stimulated industry to produce more and at a faster pace. This meant lots of projects for engineers to learn how to site, build, and install wind and solar, and that these technologies could finally begin enjoying economies of scale. Suddenly, it's not new, weird, hyper-risky, or too expensive. So, market economics begin driving it.",1582990694.0

I guess a question might be “what does working in renewable energies mean to you?”

Vehicle companies, as you might imagine, have many engineering positions available. Both mechanical and electrical. 

There are jobs you can get right out of college with an EE degree working on commissioning RE projects - anything grid tied that is larger will need an engineer’s approval. This would be driving out to sites which may be WAY out there. 

There are also jobs in building efficiency. This isn’t as sexy as energy production, but before any RE project on a building, they’ll always improve the efficiency of the building as a first step. This one you may not strictly need an engineering degree for, depending on the position. HVAC, insulation, high efficiency lighting are typical upgrades.

There are manufacturers of turbines or utility  interconnect equipment that would employ MEs and EEs. 

Large scale projects will need Engineers to design anything structural and Professional Engineers (at least in the US, this is a key-word that means you took a difficult test) to sign off on the plans. 

You could also work in manufacturing. I haven’t done any research into what components are made in the UK, but I’d be surprised if grid connect components or turbine parts are not. I found Manufacturing Engineering to be very rewarding. You get to see many parts come off the line that will then go on to projects around the world. That is its own degree program, but something that an ME, with the right internships and projects could step into. 

Just google “average starting salary of Mechanical Engineer” to find salary. RE engineers aren’t paid any more or less from standard MEs. 

Look up a company that does what you want to do and see what they’re requiring of new hires. By the way, if they say they want anything less than 5 years experience, they’re likely to hire a new grad with good internships and projects.

Power-to-X conversion technologies allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors (such as transport or chemicals), possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation.  The term power-to-x is widely used in Germany and may have originated there.

The X in the terminology can refer to one of the following: power-to-ammonia, power-to-chemicals, power-to-fuel, power-to-gas, power-to-heat, power-to-hydrogen, power-to-liquid, power-to-methane, power-to-mobility, power to food, power-to-power, and power-to-syngas.

This allows the home owner to supply the grid and guarantee a payoff of the investment. If u install batteries you can also decouple from the grid and go off grid. When you then run out of stored electricity it then flicks over to the grid and u pay ur supplier for it but because of the feedback tariff by the end of the month they end up paying u for supplying electricity. This makes it a secure investment but I can understand where you are coming from. Generally homes worth £400000 are quite large in UK terms and as a result have to be heated. Smaller homes take up less space and generally cost less excluding London and so have a lower impact. Mandatory solar would also encourage electric boilers as it just is cheaper. Considering UK emissions are basically 1/4 home emissions 1/4 transport 1/4 electricity 1/8 manufacturing 1/8 misc it represents a large portion (not by any stretch accurate figures (take with a large pinch of salt))",1584140030.0

498,ngudgeon333,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Fine. If you nitwits are so numb minded, I’ll give but a few that spring to mind:

1) solar energy in the UK is virtually useless for anyone who has lived under its climate. The stereotypes of British weather are mostly true. 

2) who’s going to subsidy it? Good solar panels ain’t exactly cheap and they need regular maintenance as their efficiency radically decreases with the slightest bit of dust (and I can’t, for example, foresee myself regularly climbing my roof to clean it if I can’t even summon the energy to clean my room) &amp; they will need repair. Don’t tell me that this is yet another ‘tax’ on the ‘rich’ who already have the burden of a 45% income tax, a 5% SDLT tax, ridiculous VAT rates, national insurance, a 40% inheritance tax on top of a host of other expensive taxes the U.K. government has levied against its wealthier &amp; average citizens. In fact, most houses in the U.K. have skyrocketed price wise, so this might as well be a burden against most of the U.K. citizenry.

3) the aesthetics of the house - you’re removing the choice for people to choose how their house looks. Solar panels ain’t exactly pretty.

4) out of all energy sources, solar is one of the less efficient and constant. To my knowledge, there are limited technologies that permit the storage of solar energy and the production of solar panels also emits carbon. 

5) solar panels also have a life. It recently transpired that wind turbines have a lifespan, after which there is no way to recycle them and so thousands of them ended up in landfill sites. Why is this different for solar panels?

6) then there’s the element of choice. People have a right to choose who/what their energy supplier is. Just because some politically active cumboi decides that solar is the way to go, the victim of this folly might realise there are better alternatives to solar energy. 

These are but a few points but I can go on.

1) in the uk we get around 900 - 1000 W/m2 of solar irradiation - its by no means the best resource in the world, but 100MW solar farms get built here without subsidies so I imagine the financiers know what they are doing. Its not that different to many parts of the Northern US. In energy terms they pay for themselves in about 3-4 years. That is far from useless

2) There is a small subsidy in place already - it may be made more generous again soon, but I can't answer that other than to say subsidies generally only come from government.

3) OK your choice - I don't mind them myself

4) I can't quite believe you said this. Across the US (I assume you are from the US) people have been using battery systems WITHOUT solar - just because they allow you to buy cheap electricity at night then use it in the day - this is hardly an immature technology, you have a major battery manufacturer called Tesla. Yes it takes energy to make solar panels - I refer you back to 1).

5) It is possible to recycle solar panels. - but other things also end up in landfill such as  your parts of your car, your sofa, your TV whatever. Why are you singling out Solar panels. Do you think a nuclear power station vanishes into mid air once it is done?

6) Yes there are alternatives - but everyone has a roof 

7) How can nuclear energy possibly be renewable? It relies on you putting a finite resource (Uranium) into a reactor.

There are good reasons why it can be difficult to do this on large areas of housing. Lots of solar in a tight geographical area causes problems for the network operator. In reality they would probably like to see it better distributed but it can vary from place to place as to how feasible it is to do.

Another issue is that the way the building regs are structured at the moment there is no way you can mandate any single measure - there is a scoring scheme and developers or self builders are only obliged to pass this test - they can do it how they like.

2. We are increasing green generation very rapidly as the economic incentives align mostly through wind which is better suited to the Uk
3.  That said we need to increase electricity capacity four fold if we are to meet enough of our energy needs. This is best done by big systems.

We need to look much more systematically at alternative ways of reducing emissions. 

Transportation aside heating is the largest emitter. We use natural gas overwhelmingly to heat our buildings. For new buildings heat pumps are a very good solution. For existing buildings they are basically useless. The only real alternative is hydrogen pumped through the existing network.

The other, largely ignored, emitter is the embodied carbon in new buildings which accounts for 11% of the UK’s CO2 emissions. A powerful set of vested interests stymies any action on this. We know what is needed here but lack the political will to demand better buildings.

There are tons of rules in the contract and whatever I learned was a bit unbelievable, although that maybe pretty standard in the industry.

General principles:
1. Maximise solar collection surface area. 
2. Optimise solar collection material  properties (black, rough, metallic for distribution of heat across the collector). 
3. Align the normal of the solar collection area with the average angle of incidence for the sun (probably quite tricky but with Ghana being on the equator, the sun's angle of incidence is somewhat more consistent). 
4. Insulate surface between room and chinney. 
5. Plant trees or build shade around the underground pipe's intake to draw in potentially cooler (from the shade) air.

552,thedanodewi,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Certainly an impact of some kind. Ultimately they will provide another source for air flow and therefore limit the impact of the intake pipe. Pardon me if you already know this, but a solar chimney works by creating a pressure differential across the room that draws air out the chimney and in through an intake. If you provide additional intakes, then some proportion of the oncoming air will be drawn in through those. It largely depends on which has the higher pressure, the underground pipe or the additional window/vent as to which provides more of the flow. I do not know enough to guess which, its all based on the environment and one might have to do some CFD there. I have access to Fluent, I am by no means an expert and have not used it recently but could maybe offer some help there. 

If you already have the underground pipe, why do you require additional ventilation holes? If the room is not that large does it need additional ventilation? I'm not knowledgeable on this, your architect may have a better idea. 

Your other big consideration is wind. Which is terribly unpredictable. Wind that runs directly normal to an intake will provide a large pressure differential and force more air in (but its also going to be cooler air so that's a win) , whilst wind that runs parallel to an opening will actually serve to ""suck"" air out. Definitely something to consider when placing and sizing your windows. Definitely facing away from the sun otherwise they will counteract the chimney. 

Certainly the system works more efficiently with just the underground pipe as an intake so I would suggest vents/windows that can be closed easily so that the users can provide additional ventilation when they want to but otherwise keep it closed to maximise the cooling effect.

I suppose you are trying to avoid electricity. Perhaps this is for redundancy reasons or for lack of access... Would you consider some sort of Solar Powered Air Mover attached to the underground pipe, to force air in through that intake thus ensuring ventilation?",1585215440.0

616,cleanenergymba,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"I wrote a blog post on common roles for MBA students. I'd imagine law would be similar. You can check out the full article here:  [https://www.cleanenergymba.com/post/common-mba-roles-in-cleantech](https://www.cleanenergymba.com/post/common-mba-roles-in-cleantech) . Re-pasted below.

**Leadership Programs / Rotational Programs:**

(typically large, established corporations)

Leadership programs are designed for recent graduates to gain expertise within a **specific company, with the goal** to eventually move on to a **senior leadership** position. Recent grads typically do two to four rotations over a two or three-year period, with the goal of transitioning into a more senior operating role into a business unit after. It’s often an excellent way to meet senior executives at the company and is often seen as an accelerated path towards the C-suite.

The good news about these types of programs is there’s no ‘required’ background, so if you’re not from a traditional pre-MBA background, you won’t get dinged. Furthermore, because you’re technically not part of a business unit’s P&amp;L (i.e. you get allocated as a corporate expense) during the first couple of years, you’re essentially given two years to explore the company and decide what role you want to end up (e.g. retail energy operations vs M&amp;A?). 

These roles are common in oil &amp; gas companies, but utilities and other large companies love MBAs for these positions on and often come on campus to recruit. Some well-known companies offering such programs include **PG&amp;E**, **Duke Energy**, **BP**, **Exelon, Chevron**…etc. I’m sure there are a lot more, but these are the first few that come to mind. I think a number of ex-PG&amp;E rotational alum have gone on to pretty interesting companies, so it’s worth to poking around on Linkedin to see where graduates have gone. 

**Project Development / Project Finance / Corporate Finance** 

(Large corporations, utilities, investment banks, development shops)

Finance is one of the more valued skills in energy, and many companies recruit specifically for project finance roles. Some companies will have finance leadership rotations (similar to above), whereas other companies will have specific project finance or structured finance openings. 

An MBA internship or new grad program is likely the easiest way to break into project finance, since most of these companies are fine with teaching you the ropes. Companies that have these positions are large developers (e.g. SunPower, Invenergy, First Solar, Recurrent), or the development arm of large utility companies (e.g. Nextera Energy Resources). Some independent companies such as Bloom will post finance roles targeted towards MBA grads as well. 

It’s better to come from some type of corporate finance, analytics, or (ideally) investment banking background, but I’ve seen friends and classmates successfully recruit for these roles from non-traditional backgrounds.

**Business Development / Strategic Partnerships:** 

(Varies from large corporates to smaller startups)

Business development seems to be one of those catch all phrases and can mean everything from sales, strategy, M&amp;A, strategic partnerships…etc. It’s up to you to find out what the exact nature of the role is, but most roles require some a set of client-facing and strategy skills, which make these great for those coming from sales, marketing, or consulting backgrounds. 

I think these companies are usually pretty interesting and see value in having a structured go-to-market strategy and are often backed by high-profile investors. Some startups I’ve seen with interesting business development roles include Bloom, AMS, Stem, Chargepoint, EnerNOC…. pretty much every VC-backed small-mid-size company. 

**Product Marketing / Product Management** 

(Startups and mid-size companies): 

You’ll notice both product marketing and product management roles are found in many consumer and B2B tech companies, so logically these roles are typically found in SV companies with a tech or software focus. The product can range from software (e.g. FirstFuel, Bidgely Networks, EnerNOC), hardware (e.g. Flex, Enphase), or financial products (e.g. Spruce, Mosaic, Renovate).

There’s a lot more that can be found online on product marketing and product management, and the required skillsets will vary between prior programming knowledge, previous marketing background …etc. Since these companies are typically smaller, they’re likely taking only 1 or 2 people for each role, so competition can be difficult.

Above are just some of the more common roles I’ve seen posted that suit MBA candidates, but there are dozens and dozens more (e.g. sales ops, supply chain). If you have a strong analytical background, maybe a sales ops, analytics, or data science gig might be more appealing. If you’re interested in operations, there are dozens of operations, procurement, and supply chain roles out there. The easiest way to find out what type of cleantech mba roles out there is just to go out and look for them.

Just like every other industry - renewable energy including solar will impacted in one way or another.  Utility scale projects take several years sometimes (unless you are doing one in ERCOT it seems like) to develop and there are numerous permits and approvals needed by local jurisdiction and regulatory parties.  As you can imagine with the current situation, municipalities and these bodies are kind of shutdown. 

Summarized points of how the industry can be impacted

1) Permits will be delayed which means projects will get delayed.  

2) majority of renewable energy equipment comes from oversees specifically Asia - so the supply chain is wrecked currently and will cause liquidated damages under contracts and delays (hopefully covered in the material documents). 

3) Will be interesting to see how natural gas prices + oil prices impact the levelized cost of solar and other renewable energy generation. 

4) Future demand for the short-term will go down a little

Needless to say the industry is a bright one to be in, lots of jobs and opportunities to grow.

Solar should exist on a family by family level, and power grids/utilities should be limited to industrialized areas and the surrounding suburbs.

However, it has not worked well for renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Major delays within the Article 10 process have resulted in a massive bottleneck -- jeopardizing over 8,000 gigawatt-hours per year of land-based wind and solar projects pending before the state’s Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment (known as the “Siting Board”), which considers these applications.

The near term solution (10-50 years) is synthetic fuel made via Fischer-Tropsch process. This method can use biomatter as a feedstock to make a very clean diesel/JetA substitute. It is already certified in many existing turbofan engines. 

Electricity is great for many things, but not high speed, long distance flight. Chemical batteries just aren’t energy dense enough. Airplanes are essentially limited by weight. The energy density of even the most advanced batteries are a factor 100 away from Jet-A on a weight basis. Recall that chemical batteries just store energy in chemical bonds, so you are unlikely to get more bond-dense than a hydrocarbon! 

And just to mess up all of the back-of-envelope math folks have tried to do in this thread... two additional issues for batteries and commercial flight. 

1&gt; There are very real issues with getting even close to current aircraft speeds with electric engines. It’s a limitation of the physics of using a motor to spin props/fans. Turbofans generate their thrust by extracting thermodynamic forces of heating and expanding gases. No electric motor aircraft will fly efficiently any anything more than say 400kph. Most airliners fly at twice that. Our civilization will not accept such a retreat. 

2&gt; Jet aircraft lose weight and gain efficiency as they fly, because up to half of their weight is in the fuel they carry/burn. The amount of fuel is adjusted per flight. With batteries you have to carry all the weight the entire journey.",1586833352.0

This is not true. If you look up online, they generate majority of their thrust from the inlet fan (same thing an electric can produce). The way that jet engines utilize hot combusted vapors is similar to how an LPG plant heats steam then drops the steam pressure across a turbine generating electricity. 

Alternatively, an electric motor can surely turn the jet fan to produce similar thrust to a jet engine. The problem is that the battery weight required for this is makes long distance, mass transport infeasible. Couple that with very long recharge times to refuel a battery, and even if you could make the plane fly, you would need 2x the aircraft to replace 1x utilizing jet fuel.",1586868598.0

Due to special cuts in the feed-in tariffs in the beginning of 2019, there was a larger addition of solar capacitys in the previous months (especially January 2019), which is why the expansion was greater than in years before.  All in all, we in Germany are still benefiting from the boom years 2010-2012. Overall, the expansion is far too small.

The addition of solar capacity through PPA contracts is probably coming to a near standstill due to low electricity prices (low oil/gas prices + low demand through corona).

Also when the cumulative installed solar capacity reaches 52 GW, there will be no more subsidies for plants under 750 kW. The politic promised to lift this cap since ages but hasn't acted yet and probably won't do it for a while due to corona. 

We may see hard times for solar installers in Germany again after the collapse following 2012.

The situation is much worse for the wind industry, however.  It has collapsed from an expansion of 1.8 GW in 2017 to 0.3 GW in 2019.  The reasons are complaints and lack of acceptance among the population.

722,brool215,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"I'm a Renewable Energy Consultant - Mainly do owner's engineer work for clients building generation and storage plants in tropical islands - integrating into the diesel systems those islands usually have. 

Tasks include construction supervision, site assessments, feasibility analysis, testing and commissioning, local government liason and stakeholder management. 

Projects I work on are mainly 500kW-1MW Solar-PV, often with battery storage 200kWh-600kWh. Some grid-following, some grid-forming if the Diesel Island grid is small enough. 

I've also done a couple of research assignments funded by the United Nations, one in electric infrastructure planning for transport fleet electrification of an island nation, and one in technology availability and local capacity to support village electrification with renewables (solar-PV, batteries, micro-hydro and efficient cook stove and crop drying designs). 

My background - I have a Masters degree in Renewables Engineering and Energy Efficiency. Spent 5 years in one of my country's research agencies (Kinda like a cross between the US Energy Agency and the US Navy Research Laboratory), worked my way up leading various research projects in the Power and Energy space. Have been consulting for 2 years now, but still kinda halfway between government and industry. As the tropical island projects are typically government aid or NGO funded.

Currently trying to figure out how to progress all our projects more remotely, as getting to these islands is nigh on impossible for the next year or so. - remote engineering inspections or milestone signoff may be in order.

Great that you work in diesels/control  - they have a massive role to play still in all these island grids, particularly interfacing with the new grid forming inverters - this is one of our biggest challenges, whether the diesels are standby or prime movers.

My advice is try to get yourself on more of caterpillars projects where they are interfacing with grid-forming inverters, maybe around that couple of MW size. This know-how is absolute gold, there are a lot of electricity companies in islands round the world who know how to run diesel generators, but their staff struggle with integration into new systems. Diesels have a roll to play phasing in renewables in these islands for at least the next 20+ years.",1587363616.0

750,bfg_hightower,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Right. So here some info according to me. WARNING: this is somewhat of an essay. 

DISCLAIMER: These are MY opinions developed over 15 years of working my way up the ranks (I am now VP / Senior Director level and employ 30+ people across three countries and have worked for some of Europe's largest/best known renewables companies). I will not guarantee the below is scientifically accurate, but I believe the below to be the truth. 

Briefly on me. I started out with very little in the way of relevant academic quals, but added some along the way when I could afford e.g. an MBA. (Congrats by the way for earning an engineering degree, as you can see here: your area has the greatest energy skills shortage - https://www.powermag.com/global-report-warns-of-looming-skills-shortages-in-power-nuclear-renewables-sectors/). I fell into my first job in renewables through a friend of a friend who was short-staffed and needed someone to join the company and help out with some short-term work on a 5-week contract on a new type of project they were working on. I was there for six years. Although I earned very little in the first few years of my career, the experiences I gathered have made me pretty employable. Starting with a small start-up/transitional business really helped as I was exposed to such a wide range of areas as project tendering (bidding for work - selling the dream aka convincing big companies that they really wanted my dinky employer to do work for them), project origination and development (does that look like a good place for a turbine? It's kinda windy here...), community engagement programmes (how to be shouted at in six languages), strategic technology investment (if we give you money now, then you guarantee us exclusivity to build your devices forever? great!)  that I could pick-and choose experiences for reference for later career changes.

Basically the renewable energy industry is really beginning to take off world-wide. The slow move towards electric vehicles is solidifying the future of electricity markets, and with more and more connected devices we are constantly looking for larger volumes of electricity for export to an ever growing populace. Meanwhile solar and wind are now cheapest form of electricity generation (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-19/solar-and-wind-power-so-cheap-they-re-outgrowing-subsidies). Plus oil &amp; gas has garnered a reputation for no longer being the cash cow it once was + has been the runner-up 'bad guy' energy player for some time (first place goes to coal). 

imo the main electricity generation markets to consider are solar,  onshore wind, offshore wind, hydro (dams), wave, tidal and biomass-in order of priority if I was starting afresh. Offshore wind is pretty sexy at the moment, probably pays above average and is diversifying at a dizzying rate into such weird and wonderful areas as floating wind farms (which are not connected to the seabed via a foundation), but there is and always will be an infrastructure cost associated that cannot be ignored. Also the power has to be taken to shore...then distributed... Solar and onshore wind energy are pretty mainstream now - but I am fully expecting us to be seeing wholescale shift to these technologies across the board as they are cheapest and most accessible for communities to go off-grid. All of the above will require a significant evolution and investment into electricity storage - whether electro-chemical battery or electrolysed hydrogen, the jury is still out but some seriously big players are investing in hybrid projects now with integrated storage solutions. Lastly I have a very warm spot in my heart for stand-alone green hydrogen projects, I sincerely believe with the right investment green hydrogen (i.e. hydrogen produced by electrolysis using only renewable electricity) will become one of the biggest sources of energy for communities. It addresses transport fuel (fuel cell vehicles are alive and well, despite what Elon might tell you), heating, and electricity - all the technical puzzle pieces fit in place, it is only a matter of the economics of the technology needing to be correct. 

The way the industry seems to primarily operate world wide:
Policy setters/government led initiatives provide a policy environment within which renewables can be financed and built (often but not always with some formal incentive system); electricity transmission infrastructure is either built by utilities/developers or national players/gov quangos; developers (sometimes utility-integral, sometimes stand-alone) originate, develop, consent and often build projects (if utility integral); specialist infrastructure finance groups leverage shareholding in projects for financing the construction; specialist construction companies are brought in to build the assets; either utilities or  independent operators own and operate the assets and sell the electricity direct to grid/utilities or as power purchase agreements to industrial demand centres.

The breadth and depth of the renewable energy supply-chain is truly staggering. IRENA (https://www.irena.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2019/Jun/11-Million-People-Employed-in-Renewable-Energy-Worldwide-in-2018) reckons there are currently in excess of 11 million people employed worldwide in the sector and as I mentioned above there is already a skills shortage with a looming black hole that's going to need bodies real soon. 

In terms of key players to look out for, this report from Europe gives an interesting oversight: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/supply-chain-renewable-energy-technologies-europe-analysis-wind-geothermal-and-ocean-energy.

Yadayadayada - all above, so far so good. But how do I get my first job, who do I apply to...right?

Well for that you will need to first decide which sector you are most interested in, then you need to decide if starting pay is more important than potential breadth of experience. Do you want to help change the world, launch a new technology or sector? Or do you want long-term career stability?

Here's the truth as I experienced it: 

Working for a major international utility such as AVANGRID/Iberdrola/Scottish Power (that's one company...look it up) or Statkraft, Equinor, RWE/Innogy, Orsted, Vattenfall, EnBW, EDPR, SSE, Dominion Energy, Engie or a global supply-chain leader (aka Tier 1) such as MHI Vestas, GE, Siemens Gamesa etc. will probably see you earning a bit more to start with and you will have greater stability, but you will A) not see as much of a diverse exposure to skills and experiences and B) salary progres will be slower and C) let's face it, you won't be CEO of the company in ten years unless you are really special (or related to or married to the right person) and D) there will be ALOT more competition for every role.  

Whereas if you go and work with a start-up or niche player such as http://www.tridentwinds.com/ (or many others) you will have less stability/guarantees and/or money in the short term, but you will play a critical role in the growth of the business, and will be rewarded quickly for being a hard worker and competent at your job and you will have a broad cross-section experience to look back on.

So how to find what's right for you? Take a look at a niche renewable job recruiter such as https://www.taylorhopkinson.com/renewable-energy-jobs/. Take a look at all of the roles that include engineering degree in the must haves, and think about which of the roles are most attractive to you right now and which ones you could see yourself working towards. Do you feel like the generators themselves are more your thing? Dont just stop with the generator manufacturers, think about the guys who have to install, service or repair them...companies such as Boskalis, GeoSea/DEME, Subsea 7 etc. Also consider that each wind generator is made up of a couple of thousand parts - there are a host of companies that just provide e.g. gearboxes or drive trains, it is rare that the industry is fully vertically integrated like GE or Siemens. 

Also consider the technical consultants out there, like Atkins or Xodus or Arup or Wood Group. They are CONSTANTLY hiring graduates and can be an amazing starting point.

Take a look at this list of supply-chain companies as an example https://n415.fmphost.com/fmi/webd/OSWSupplyChain.fmp12?script=FindServices every single one of the companies on this list is likely to expect growth in renewables. Every one of them is going to need engineers at some point.

Consider also companies that help facilitate industry and projects, companies such as https://www.offshorewindus.org/ are critical to ensuring the lines of communication and networks are built and maintained. European equivalents would be the likes of https://windeurope.org/ and https://www.renewableuk.com/. All of these companies are membership driven, so will list all their members somewhere on their website - read through the list, find the websites of those companies and get onto their various careers pages!

Anyhow, I have just scrolled up to the top of this message and seen how long it is. My apologies for filling up your thread with this, but I sincerely hope that there is SOMETHING of use here for you. 

There will be jobs in renewables for you, both in the U.S. and further afield. You just need to decide what you want to prioritize and which direction you want to start off in.

I'm not sure what portion of the transportation industry you're referring to, Trains?  Planes?  Ships? Other?

There are also other possibilities, new battery technologies like lithium titanate, and people may discover new energy sources, or new understandings of electronics and physics may arise.

3D printing is already farther along than most people realize.  New materials may become available for 3D printing, with our current technology, it's a matter of time.

The point about 3D printing is that if you download the product diagrams, and print your own parts, those don't need to be transported.

Food works better when it's locally-grown thus fresh and not requiring transportation.  Amazon has been working on drone deliveries, and those are probably battery-powered.

Maybe there are whole aspects of the thing that I'm not seeing, but I think an individual family can be energy independent for a very small cost, and if you're energy independent and you grow your own food, there isn't that much you need to buy.

791,dodobringer,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Solar developer here. I can tell you where we are now and work from there - 2050 is so far out I can almost guarantee any paper you read on this will be way off.

For a 2023 project, the top of the line panels are likely going to be bifacial panels using mono PERC technology that are getting close 500 W (frontside) per module (using 78 cells vs the more traditional 72 halfcut cells panel). These are probably just around 20% efficiency, but i've seen some manufacturers predict higher efficiencies by 2023. These are probably going to be in the mid-to-high 20c/W range price-wise since the Section 201 tariffs would have rolled off by then (this is including transport to US from Chinease / SouthEast Asian manufacturing locations).

Going out to 2050... another 27 years out, i would guess a whole other chemistry would be in play. Most promising research i hear about today are tandem cells (effectively splits photon to high and low band gap photons to improve efficiency), perovskite cells, and quantum dot cells. I'm sure you've seen [NREL's chart](https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html) depicting current cell technology research. It looks like perovskite tandem cells are starting to beat out mono-crystalline cells in efficiency. I think perovskite could get traction but would need to solve the lead issue first. I think the dark horse here will be Organic PV (OPV). They have the potential to be mass produced and can be dirt cheap (i think stability and efficiency are the current issue with these today), and with 27 years of additional research maybe it can reach a stage where it can be commercialized.

Given you are land constrained, probably the more efficient cell tech would better utilize the space as construction costs would still be relatively expensive so let's assume the tandem perovskite and let's say it achieve 30% efficiency for commercial products - we might be seeing 750 W modules and 2 acres / MWdc for fixed tilt. Assuming module prices are also pretty cheap (call it 10-15c/Wdc), you'd probably be overbuilding your MWdc capacity more and so would have a DC/AC ratio of 1.5-1.75, so you are probably closer to 3-3.5 acres / MWac, or 37-43 MWac at your site.",1587881345.0

801,hendricksar,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"I work as an energy scheduler for a renewable energy firm so maybe I can shed a little light on this. 

First, those who mentioned subsidies are correct. Fossil fuels receive money from both local and federal governments depending upon location and recently in the US, there has been additional funding put into some plants in order to keep jobs in place. This means that electricity from fossil plants can cost less while still maintaining a positive bottom line. 

Next, renewables on a larger scale are a more recent thing, so tie ins to transmission interconnections is a bit harder. This is especially true with wind and solar, which are often placed in more remote areas, meaning more transmission infrastructure is needed out there. To make up costs, renewables sometimes need to sell their electricity at a higher price. 

One other key note is that prices fluctuate throughout a day. Pricing averages are often skewed since demand peaks in the evenings when electricity prices fluctuate the most. This means that renewables during the day could be much lower cost, but could rise in price in the evening when demand is high, causing their value to look higher. 

There are all sorts of other things that can influence prices as well. Battery and other energy storage will also be a big factor in how renewables pricing is set as well.

I suspect in this case it’s a way for the utility to keep the profit the same for fossil and renewables. In general, regulated monopoly utilities get to make a percentage profit over cost with both capital expenses and operating (aka fuel) expenses. The *problem* with renewables like wind and solar is fuel cost is zero and zero times anything is zero.  And the capital costs aren’t higher either. 

And if you’re thinking that’s whacked, you’d be right. We should be making the utilities convert and earn less - not making customers pay more for something that costs less. It’s at the point now where most places it’s cheaper to build a new solar or wind farm then it is to fuel a coal plant.

We as consumers will just keep consuming non stop. So we will never be able to make enough solar panels to satiate our apetite. If we as a country would agree on a cap of how much energy, pollution, deforestation, etc per capita we will be able to use and year after year we will never go over that amount maybe technology would save us.

&gt;  
&gt;Nuclear is saddled with regulations to prevent another Chernobyl

Nuclear was saddled with layers of regulations way before either of those incidents happened. 

Chernobyl happened because of a long list of worst possible scenario factors all happening at once, and it's literally impossible for an accident to happen like that here in the U.S.

Fukushima happened because of some worst-case scenario factors happening, combined with TEPCO having cut corners before the tsunami. And even then, the release of radioactive material was mostly mitigated by the design of the reactor plant and the inherent passive safety measures that were built in. Also, it was an older plant that doesn't have some of the same safety features found in most American plants. 

Nuclear is expensive because we've been out of the habit of building them for so long, and a lot of opportunity for innovation was lost for two decades. There are prototype and theoretical designs that are much safer, and have much longer fuel cycles, and could possibly be cheaper if they were built and deployed at a large enough scale.",1588115111.0

1) The field is arranged to intercept virtually all the sunlight hitting the site so any plants underneath aren't going to grow very well.

2) Electronics generally prefer not to be irrigated. 

3) Driving through and over solar panels can increase maintenance costs for farm machinery.

4) Weed control is already a large factor in solar field maintenance.

Rotting food produces methane. If you compost it it will release that methane into the air where it will act as a powerful greenhouse gas. If you contain the food as it rots you can take that methane and burn it for energy. Burning methane does not produce greenhouse gases and is thus much better for´the climate.

&gt; Plus expecting to power anything with leftover food is a pipe dream. 

It is already being done. Many places are doing it - also right here where I live in Odense, Denmark.  Of course you can't expect to power entire countries with it, but every little bit of green energy helps.

We agree and no one here is claiming otherwise. With regards to waste, however, we need to get rid of all our waste somehow.

To cite wikipedia

&gt;Electric locomotives benefit from the high efficiency of electric motors, often above 90% (not including the inefficiency of generating the electricity). Additional efficiency can be gained from regenerative braking, which allows kinetic energy to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line. Newer electric locomotives use AC motor-inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance. Power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives are ideal for commuter rail service with frequent stops. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks.

That would allow you to present LCOE in one region as x times larger/smaller than LCOE in the other region. This would come with assumptions in the denominator of the LCOE formula, with the biggest one I can think of being that the technology generates the same electrical power output for a given wave power, independent of location (probably a weak assumption, but I'm just guessing). Using a ratio of two LCOE's would still allow you to tailor the numerator of the LCOE equation to reflect the different OPEX/CAPEX costs between freshwater and salt water installations.

Without doing the math, I'm not sure if the above is possible, particularly if there is a large electricity contract price differences between these regions. But maybe there's a unique way to structure the denominator to cancel that out, or to present your findings at a variety of power price points.

If you want to present actual LCOE's for comparison and not just use a ratio of two LCOE's, or if the assumption that the technology's efficiency is constant between the Californian coast and Lake Michigan is too weak, you would need to select a technology to use as a basis for comparison.

Right now, depending on location, that might be balanced by vehicle cost, which the report doesn't cover, but again most forecasts have the price of EVs dropping and becoming cheaper to buy upfront as well in the next couple of years.

As for the capacity increase, I'm guessing that's just an artifact of moving to lots of solar. Solar only generates at its peak near midday so it generally has about a 20% capacity factor.

They're still going to have EVs, and while I think batteries will probably be fine for large transport at a certain point, South Korea is quite industrial, big players + shipping may think it's more economical to just fuel their vehicles with fuel they have on tap, instead of figuring out how to setup a bunch of 1MW chargers and deal with pulling from the grid, grid charges, grid balancing, etc, especially if it's at ports / used for maritime stuff.

The good thing is, they'll probably innovate a whole bunch of shit in the next 15 years, probably entirely new methods for industry that we don't know of yet, as it'll encourage their domestic national plans to reduce cost + come up with ways to use it. Then they can export the expertise + equipment + industrial stuff + maritime innovation.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example https://reneweconomy.com.au/wind-and-solar-kill-coal-and-nuclear-on-costs-says-latest-lazard-report-52635/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc.

970,runtime_error22,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"""Per kWh"" is a red herring.

It ignores the costs of actual real world construction costs, which are always added on top of the operational costs, as well as the profit margin, which are paid for largely by the working class. Nuclear is also not cheaper operationally than solar, nor onshore wind. 

France - Flamanville 3 - $15billion for 1.6GW so far, not done yet. France's average reactor is 35 years old. 

UK - Hinkley C - EDF (France's nuclear squad) owns it. About $26 billion so far in construction costs for 3.2GW. 35-year price at about $120/MWh or so now, tied to inflation, already multiple times more than the wholesale cost of electricity. If you include opportunity costs that they could have build out instead, total cost will be more like $50-60 billion. Probably more. The French couldn't get it done, so China has a 30% stake now. China will get $40/MWh from the UK people, tied to inflation, from a 3.2GW nuclear reactor, until about 2060. 

South Carolina - $9 billion, project catered, working class on the hook.

Vogtle - About $25-28 billion for 2.3GW. $12-13 billion in Federal Loan Guarantees (aka taxpayer funds). Costs are just for construction, does not include the operational or profit margin that will be added on top, collected from the people through higher electricity prices. 

These don't include costs for decommissioning, which can take decades. If France doesn't bail out EDF, it's likely they go bankrupt with decommissioning + waste disposal expected costs of over $60 billion, with debt at $30 billion+, or they'll just get let off the hook. If Hinkley's decommissioning + waste disposal costs is over a couple billion, it's on the UK taxpayers. Germany's expecting about $1.4 billion/GW in decommissioning costs. UK is expecting about $2.7 billion/GW. The UK's decommissioning costs are already expected to be about $150 billion over the next century, largely funded by the taxpayers. The US utility that built Vogtle, will probably do the American thing and somehow strip the assets, declare bankruptcy, and put it on the taxpayers, they don't care, they all got fat bonuses, are going to make a killing. And they'll all be dead before they have to worry about it.

- ""It's too expensive!"" I think this is mostly wrong. People rely on costs per installed capacity, which is a TERRIBLE way of measuring energy sources. Installed capacity is the maximum amount of power that a particular installation will generate. Nuclear power stations in the United States on average operate at 93.5% of their installed capacity while wind and solar operate at 34.5% and 24.5% capacity respectively. This is never accounted for by those who decry nuclear as being too expensive. Furthermore, generation 3 reactors onward can realistically be run for 100 years, while solar panels, at best, last 30. For base load energy, per KwH, cost estimates should represent these factors to be expensive.

- ""It's too expensive!!! Part Dos"": France generates 72% of its electricity from nuclear plants, and its electricity is still cheaper than that of: Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland, Japan, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, the UK, Spain, Czech Republic, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, and a ton of smaller countries. Yes, it's more expensive than some countries, but real talk: it can be done if countries build more than one plant at a time.

- Investment cost averages used to dismiss nuclear tend to rely on examples of facilities built/designed 20 or 30 years ago. Imagine if that same standard was held to the limitations of solar and battery sources from 1990. New modular designs have much lower costs, and they're rapidly scalable, so the up front costs can be lower!

Geothermal energy is still plenty viable outside of volcanic regions, in fact there was a Geothermal power plant built in [southern Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/drilling-geothermal-plant-sask-1.4917287) after oil drilling rigs discovered an underground source of hot water.

They may also be distant from population centers, increasing the need for connecting to a distant grid.

**Tesla request reveals deep divide among Texas agencies over battery power**

A simmering dispute between the state's electric grid manager and the Public Utility Commission has burst into view over a request by Tesla to make it easier to develop battery storage systems in Texas.

Texas regulators and ERCOT have been struggling for more than two years over how to accommodate developing battery storage technology that experts predict could accelerate demand for renewable energy sources and ultimately reduce electricity prices.

Large batteries can be charged from solar units or other forms of energy at night when power is cheapest and the stored energy sold when prices peak during midday. But Texas has been slow to adopt the technology,

Integrated battery storage systems - essentially self-contained ready-to-go units that sit on concrete slabs - are becoming more sophisticated sources of low-cost and resilient power for manufacturing sites, office buildings and homes.

Tesla filed an urgent request last month with ERCOT, asking the grid manager to make it clear that integrated battery systems are considered wholesale storage.

The dispute illustrates the ongoing power struggle in Texas between those at companies like Tesla who are pushing new technology such as the self-contained battery system and an electricity grid manager overseen by a board dominated by the power industry.

Generators don’t want to see a new source of competition which battery storage would be, said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston, and ERCOT is essentially acting as the gatekeeper to keep storage companies out.",1589835527.0

https://www.enelfoundation.org/topic/a/2019/12/large-scale--long-duration-energy-storage--and-the-future-of-ren

They model lots of hypothetical technologies with different price points and basically say that for short term storage up to 4hrs then the price of lithium makes sense, but as you increase the storage time you need much cheaper materials to make the business case work, but you can still add value with something with 40-60% efficiency as long as it's cheap enough.

&gt; A large class of electrochemical systems, which 
have long been neglected because of their low-rate capabilities and lower 
than Lithium-ion round-trip efficiencies, may very well become the enabling 
technology at the heart of LODES. Systems based on cheap, abundant 
materials such as water, air and certain metals can achieve extremely low $/
kWh cost, at the expense of low round trip efficiencies (in the range 40%-70%) 
and high self-discharge rates (&gt;5%/month). However, these drawbacks should 
be weighed against emerging grid conditions. If future grids do involve large 
amounts of inexpensive renewable electricity, low round-trip efficiencies can 
be tolerated. Moreover, LODES will necessarily have a much smaller yearly 
cycle count than a short-duration storage system and cycle life requirements 
can be correspondingly relaxed from the several thousands of a Lithium-ion 
system to a few hundreds or a few tens for a system with durations between

Also, there is nothing stopping a modern inverter from providing this grid voltage. What you may refer to is that when electricity demand exceeds the supply temporarily, this excess energy is provided by the rotational energy of these large generators (which makes them turn slower, thereby decreasing the grid frequency). Without a way for providing this energy very quickly, parts of the grid have to be disconnected to prevent the entire grid from failing. But the machines' rotation is not the only possible source for this energy - batteries would also work (and actually be superior for this, as they wouldn't decrease the grid frequency).

&gt; Zinc-air has long been touted as a potentially cheap and powerful form of energy storage, but it always seemed to have a fundamental flaw - the formation of a bumpy coating of zinc on the electrode called a dendrite, which caused short circuits and other problems.

&gt; The costs of vanadium redox flow technology - arguably the most advanced eight-hour battery on the market - doesn&amp;#039;t even come close to zinc-air, with capital costs of about $400/kWh and levelized cost of storage more than double that of the Zinc8 technology.

&gt; The battery itself consists of three parts - the &amp;quot;Zinc regenerator&amp;quot;, which generates the charged zinc particles; the storage tank, which contains the potassium hydroxide electrolyte and holds the charged zinc; and the power stack, a kind of fuel cell that turns the zinc to zincate and delivers its charge back to the grid.

1083,Godspiral,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"&gt; $100/mwh for 10 hours LCOS, ~$200/Mwh/10 hours capex.  System they are manufacturing.

LCOS seems like a broken measure.

1. highly dependent on cost of capital assumptions.  This can be substantially lowered through government policy, and ""refinancing"" of completed projects that offer 

2. battery duration is based on charging rate, faster charging is infinitely more valuable.  But discharge value is about capacity rather than rate.  Value of battery is discharged amount/day.  Main point here is, when pairing with solar, its mwh needed after sundown that is relevant.  If the majority of that is within 2 hours after sundown, then a 2-4 hour discharge rate is desirable, but the relevant measure is needed power at peak after sundown.

3. Discharge value of battery means fully discharging at least once every day.  2MW/8mwh may meet needs better than 1MW/10mwh.  Costing  per mwh may be confusing.  Where the slower battery is useful is pairing with hydrogen electrolyzers, such that it can always empty each day.

Pairing systems can be a huge benefit. 1mw/10mwh + 1mw/4mwh gives the same burst capacity as the 8mwh system.  Provides resilience/variability benefit of extra 6mwh, that can be monetized through hydrogen production if not needed. 

The same calculations apply to much smaller single home off grid systems:

The cost to do this is higher when it comes to large scale implementation, which is why it's not happening that way.

If we are installing solar to fight climate change, prevent pollution, and ultimately help the planet hold on, doing what we can to prevent additional environmental degradation and disturbance should be a priority.

Throw pallets of these bad boys on a flatbed, strap them down and that's one way to work around this problem.  And as long as a ""standard"" forklift can still handle the pallet adequately, things should go rather smoothly installation-wise.

1. Worker retraining programs to help workers employed by fossil fuels get new jobs
2. New Deal-style public works and [civil service](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/05/21/seth-moulton-national-service-plan) programs to create jobs working on environmental projects

1111,ThePinkP,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Thanks for copying the whole thing! I hadnt actually read it when I replied originally. 

If scaled using the same manufacturing techniques, materials, geometry etc. any object will comply with the square cube law, which means that the volume increases at a faster rate than the area. This is especially relevant for wind turbines as the power produced is proportional to the swept area of the turbine and the volume is proportional to the mass of material required, and hence the cost. 

I agree that it is more likely that we will reach an economical limit before we reach the physical limit with today's technology. This is summed up in the article with the following quote:

&gt;But if we'd spent a quarter billion \[DKK\] building a factory that could produce new giant wings of 120-150 meters, we'd also need a factory for the accompanying nacelle,"" he explains.  
&gt;  
&gt;""After that, you'd need to pay for the factories that subsuppliers would need to make components on that scale, and, lastly, you'd need to pay someone to build an installation vessel on that scale. Once that's done, we wouldn't be able to generate power that's cheaper than oil, coal and gas the way we can today.""

Basically what they are saying is, even though they may be able to manufacture the blades longer, they dont have the required facilities, supply chain, testing facilities etc to do it economically, so to build larger blades would ultimately increase the LCOE. And thats only the blades! You then need to develop and produce larger rated generators (specifically trying to minimise mass as they are to be placed on top of a hundreds metre high tower), higher rating power electronics, towers able to deal with larger loading and particularly high dynamic loading. 

Installation vessels are indeed very expensive to hire, and this is because they are very specialised and only a few large enough exist in the world. Your point about saving installation days in exchange for more maintenance days doesn't quite track. The thing you are not considering is that you also need very large vessels with large specialised lifting equipment to fix and replace any component that has failed, which hikes up the cost significantly. Not to mention the lost revenue from not producing electricity (turbines can wait for months to be repaired due to limited vessel availability, weather conditions etc. ) 

Additionally, the higher loading on the turbines and higher power being transmitted through the electrical equipment can lead to increased failure rates. 

My point with all this is that bigger doesnt always equal better. Im of the opinion that the industry needs to standardise around a rough scale, and this will most likely happen naturally as the industry develops. This is the same trend that happened in the aviation industry which is fundamentally designed and scaled using similar properties to wind turbines.  

There is other options as well to all this: things like multi-rotor wind turbines and airborne wind, to name a few, which could be game changers if the industry is willing to embrace them.",1590427019.0

There are definitely advantages to scaling up wind turbines (obviously as the industry is still doing it), but at a certain point the problems involved with massive turbines will become to big to work around. As with all engineering projects it must become a balancing act.

1143,thatguy314159,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Denser construction in urban areas does a bunch of things that all contribute to less vehicle miles traveled. It increased the number of people who choose to walk and use other non car modes of transport, like bicycles and scooters too. 

It increases the number of people who live within a walking distance of public transit, which helps create enough demand to fund the agency. No one is going to drop a bus rapid transit line through single family houses on an acre or more of land, let alone a tram line, light rail, or heavy rail. (I guess Indianapolis’ new red line bus rapid transit is a counter example, but it is rare to have enough ridership to justify new transit lines)

Small lot houses usually don’t have large lawns, which reduces water use.

And then there are the carbon and criteria (nox) emissions associated with space heating and cooling, even all electric heating and cooling still uses more (frequently dirty, but not always depending on location) electricity from the grid. Single family houses have significantly more area to heat and cool, compared to small lot housing, apartments, and condos. 

There are tons of reasons why housing density is a necessary part of creating sustainable cities.

And I mentioned parking minimums because mandating businesses in urban areas to have a number of parking spaces (frequently more new office construction requires by law more square footage for parking spaces than actual office space) is another problem for cities. Surface parking lots reduce density and increase space between locations, reducing walkability and increasing vehicle use between two points. Additionally, building parking garages is super expensive. In LA parking podiums (multiple floors of parking garage under floors of office or residential space) can be almost half of construction cost of low-mid rise construction. Costs of underground parking are even higher.   High costs reduce new construction, thus reducing density, reduce the ability for developers to offer cheaper housing (they have to make money back).

Edit: denser housing also reduces municipal costs associated with services in areas. The average cost to the city to provide fire departments, police departments, road service, and other services is much lower in denser areas compared to single family housing areas. And cities get more revenue per lot of denser areas than SFH areas too, which increased municipal budgets.

Because agrivoltaic systems are more expensive to install than utility solar installations, the derate factor can drastically impact how cost effective they are. Another concern with solar installations is how efficient the system is at converting the solar panel's direct current into alternating current, Using the direct current to top off batteries that replace using fossil instead of selling the power to the grid you might get a better return on investment.

Hope that helps, I'm happy to give more details either in general or on the paper I did on agrivoltaic installations in Puerto Rico and the cost break downs, but the TL:DR agrivoltaic systems cost about 1.5-2x as much as more traditional utility PV systems which means the electricity they produce will be that much more expensive",1591663009.0

[Adani Green Energy Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ADANIGR:IN) will invest 450 billion rupees ($5.96 billion) to execute what it called the world’s largest solar order.

The company will build 8 gigawatts of generation projects, while group company [Adani Solar](https://www.adanisolar.com/) will construct 2 gigawatts of manufacturing capacity for solar cells and modules, it said Tuesday in a stock exchange [filing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QBN5LI8JRZLT). The project takes Adani Green closer to its goal of becoming the [world’s largest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q4I7SGT1UM0Y) renewable power company by 2025.

The generation and manufacturing project is a sign of India’s aspirations to boost its renewable energy capacity as well as build domestic capacity for making solar equipment. Adani Green will get a fixed tariff of 2.92 rupees a kilowatt-hour from the power plant over a contract period of 25 years, it said.

The first 2 gigawatts of generation capacity will start by 2022, with the rest installed in 2-gigawatt annual increments through 2025, Adani said. The company will build the projects at various locations.

The solar manufacturing facility will be ready by 2022. The [bids](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q48OBKT0G1L2) for the projects were conducted last year by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India. Adani Green currently has almost 6 gigawatts of capacity in operation or under construction and is seeking to have 25 gigawatts installed by 2025, according to its [website](https://www.adanigreenenergy.com/).

* By focusing on solar PV and onshore wind power, this delivers a least-cost, fastest-results approach to cutting carbon emissions as fast as possible
* Aiming for 90% zero-carbon by 2035 (rather than 100%) delivers emission cuts while avoiding some of the practical challenges with current-generation technology
    * Variability in wind/solar generation becomes exponentially more of a practical challenge as they come to dominate the grid

This is why the majority of our grid backup is CCGT. Our max biomas output is 3GW. Our max CCGT capacity is 35GW. Our wind capacity is soon to be 35GW and our solar is nearing 10GW.

Biomas is literally one of the smallest grid contributors at the moment on a grid that used to derive 20GW from coal only 14 years ago. I really don't see it becoming large scale.

If you're managing forests correctly, that CO2 will be re sequestered at some point. It's already lower since the trees you're burning stored the carbon to become trees in the first place.

We arn't managing the north American forests but I should hope that there are conditions of taking the pellets that the woodlands are managed sustainably. It's also in their interests to do that. A lot of it depends on how the forest is managed, in some poor management cases, yes it can be worse.

Also, there is no radioactive fly ash to dispose of.

No it's not ideal at all, but it's a stop over to retain some of the previous coal power stations to supply the grid whilst trying to make them more environmentaly friendly.

Either way, to try and claim that this is terrible or somehow worse given the level of contribuction of biomas burning to the grid is so low is just misguided.",1592266634.0

$1,500/ acre is a lot less than they will make ($20,000 - $40,000 avg), BUT of course they have a great deal of costs. Economics may work out that $1,500 is a fair price. Dunno.

There are [considerations for transferring farm land to solar](https://craven.ces.ncsu.edu/considerations-for-transferring-agricultural-land-to-solar-panel-energy-production/). Some you would not have to worry about if they are providing all maintenance, but you should also consider the environmental impact. Of course solar is ultimately good for clean energy, but the local ecology can potentially suffer. You want to probably ask about what they do to ensure the local environment (native plan species are kept etc) is not hurt. Are they mowing and spraying herbicides to stop weeds? 

There is definitely research out there like [NREL low impact solar installations](https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2019/beneath-solar-panels-the-seeds-of-opportunity-sprout.html).

With that many acres, an interesting approach may be to push them to try new technologies with a few acres as part of the deal. Possibly ask if they have ever raised the panels and done agrivoltaics or allowed animal herding under? [Agrivoltaics is growing crops under raised panels](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2019/benefits-of-agrivoltaics-across-the-food-energy-water-nexus.html). Yes, you have fewer panels, but you still can grow some types of plants under. And some even do better with partial shade. Studies have shown that pairing farming WITH panels, actually gives a net POSITIVE economic outcome. While your PV and farming may both be reduced 30% or so, that still gives 70% PV and farming benefits, which means per area, you're getting 140% of financial yield off the land.

Some [research has been done on solar grazing](https://solargrazing.org/atkinson-center-grant/), where sheep provide the ""weeding"" maintenance.

It would be very interesting if out of the 91 acres, you asked for them to pair up with a local university or organic farmer to try some of these out on 2-5 acres worth.

Of course, this may be of no interest to you. Just offering interesting opportunities.

I have developed 3 geothermal, two nearshore windfarms and several solar all MW scale and it is all about how you can sell the power.  It is always where we start.  By the time I'm looking for land to lock in, I have a PPA agreed in principle.  The PPA is normally signed at the same time the construction contract is though,  Maybe the difference is that in my projects we try to let land owners actually own a share of the development as we are opposed to renewable exploitation.  For the nearshore Windfarms, 300 MW in Denmark, the government was auctioning off areas based on the PPA price so it is exactly where it started.

Developing renewables is not simple, and there is a huge risk that as more renewable projects are installed a market price goes negative for more hours each year. Currently 150h in Denmark you have to pay to have the company take your electricity.  In rural areas where the grid is weaker, the price falls below the LCOE often.

Options to develop are a simple tool to lock you into one developer, in a market where there are many.  Many developers will just play a cockblocking game in regards to land, that was the essence of my advice, get experts on your side, or think about how you can make the land more useful and valuable to rent out for other things.  Renewables are on a huge upsurge now so the sharks are circling and will lock you into a shitty deal as quickly as they can.

Utilities are the worst as they are financial enough to slip you a few thousand now, just to make sure you cant stop their project on your neighbors land.

Your numbers are USA only, so that may or not matter, but I was using global numbers (18% ~ 1/5 electricity based emissions)

Commercial/residential is primarily fossil fuels for heating in the USA, and while you can use electricity or geothermal for this, FF is still WAY cheaper most everywhere in the USA. 

Industrial is actually a lot more than just heat that could be replaced with electricity. Plastics from petroleum; the chemistry of cement releases CO2; steal requires coke to reduce the ore etc.

Admittedly many of these come down to cost of electrification (due to conversion inefficiencies, cheap fossil gas, etc. ), but some are simply not replaceable with existing technology: airplanes, shipping, cement, steel, plastics, lubricants.

If it was *currently* more economical to do the things that need to be done in other sectors with electricity we would have already electrified them by existing market forces alone.

1297,NorthDakotaExists,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Electrical engineer here, currently working in solar.   


In my opinion, there are several reasons why more widespread adoption of renewable energy (more specifically wind and solar)  is not currently feasible, and none of them really have much to do with the economics of them. Things like wind and solar are booming in places like Texas for example.

The problems with wind and solar becoming dominant sources of energy are more to do with actual engineering aspects. People have already touched on the issue with energy storage with regards to trying to make wind and solar act as steady state power sources. For example, with traditional forms of power generation, you can dynamically control the output of your coal/gas/oil/nuke plant to account for demand at any given time and keep that output stable. 

With wind and solar, their output curves are at the mercy of nature, and both look something like big spikes during the afternoon when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, and then little or no generation at night, and that is ignoring other factors such as day to day weather. The SCADA operators can control the output of these farms by disconnecting certain turbines/arrays from feeders to adjust for lower demand, but they cannot increase the output more than the current conditions allow. In order to do this, there needs to be some sort of accompanying energy storage infrastructure (big fkn batteries) that can be charged during times of production &gt; demand and discharged during times of production &lt; demand. This isn't so much a huge problem right now with solar/wind being such a small part of the market (they simply sell their power to utilities during times of peak production and then traditional generation fills the demand other times), but the more of the energy market that transitions to wind and solar, the bigger an issue this will be, and potentially the more expensive renewables will have to become. 

Another issue is simply geography. The regions of the country that are most rich in renewable resources such as wind and solar do not exactly line up conveniently with where most of the energy demand in the country is. With traditional power plants, you can set them up pretty much anywhere, and build more when demand increases, and transmit that power a short distance to the end user. Most places rich with solar and wind resource are places like West Texas, the Southwest, the Midwest, the Dakotas... etc. You know, not exactly in close proximity to bustling megalopolises hungry for power. In order for renewables to rise up to prominence as a major source of the nations power, EXTENSIVE transmission infrastructure  spanning across the nation would have to be implemented, and that still won't get rid of the problem of the sort of power losses involved with transmission over that much of a distance, especially with sub-optimal conductors like Al having to be used due to the economics of such a thing.   


I love wind and solar, and we should continue to invest and implement them nationwide, but as for our *primary*  source of energy, we should be going for nuclear. It's dependable, clean, and far safer than the average person has been led to believe.

Basically, it's something that should always have existed. It's not storage, but is technically balancing because it improves the efficacy of curtailment.

&gt;  I know that it isn't legal to go DIY unless you are already a licensed electrician

&gt; I said DIY solar Grid Tie systems where illegal due to using cheap, non UL listed plugin inverters and the dangers involved in them such as the potential to back feed back into the gird and endangering linemen.

This is totally different.  
DIY solar is NOT illegal.

Using non UL equipment is illegal
using a plug in connection for the inverter is illegal
Dangers of killing lineman is a small part, also killing an occupant, or rescue personel due to not having labeling, disconnects, rapid shutdown, arc fault interruption, etc etc.  Just like doing an improper wiring on an addition is unsafe and illegal.  

&gt; THAT IN ITSELF MUST BE INSTALLED BY A LICENSED ELECTRICIAN

That is crazy,  There are MANY things besides the plug that are issues, like is the installer using proper labeling, do they have a UL listed inverter, does the racking have the proper wind loads, grounding, etc etc. etc.  
We require people to follow proper safety regulations and get a permit when adding a bathroom and wiring to a house and we should do the same with a  PV system.   Any homeowner capable and knowledgeable enough to do so can get the permit and install it along with inspections and interconnect agreement.  
Also if you pay an electrician to install an outlet, you could also pay said electrician to connect an inverter.  He will insure that the other requirements are also meet like that there is disconnect, labels, arc fault, and enough capacity in the MSP, etc. 

&gt; Everything else including the inverter could be bought and plugged in like a regular appliance

THE PLUG IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  What stops someone else coming along and plugging it in someplace else.   There are of course other safety issues I have already mentioned.  

&gt; I know they sell grid tie systems at hardware stores, but these are professionally installed systems where you do have to have a permit,

ALL home improvements need a permit.  BUT those systems CAN be installed by ANY homeowner (not just a licensed professional).  Some homeowners are more knowledgeable than others..

&gt; This is expensive, and currently the only legal option.

Permits are not costly.   Mine cost $75 and included the inspections, interconnect application was $25.   

&gt; People don't want to follow all the safety regulations due to the added cost.

See thats the problem.  The permit is not the cost, it is doing things safely and correctly.  Improperly installed PV on a roof can fly off in a storm and kill someone.  Incorrectly ground or no fuses, or no arc fault protection can kill lots of someones.  

&gt; I'm suggesting adding new regulations that allow a safer and less expensive option for the average DIYer who is interested in solar grid tie systems

No what you are suggesting is a cheaper but FAR more dangerous system.  Why do you feel that PV shouldn't require a permit and inspections while other home additions do?  You already mentioned the added cost of the proper safety equipment and design as the reason.

&gt; but doesn't quite have the funds for a professional setup.

Then that person doesn't have the funds for solar. (Period) 

&gt; Until such a system is available, people are going to continue to do it the wrong and dangerous way

What you suggest is far more dangerous but also people continue to do additions on their homes and modifications without permits in very dangerous ways as well, unrelated to solar.  

&gt; Thus lowering the initial cost for small grid tie systems of less than 2KW.

""Initial""?

1371,ButchDeal,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"&gt; Yes, I am absolutely sure the max running voltage of my PV system is configured for 80 volts on the output.

&gt; Sure, it will be a bit higher in cold weather.

&gt; but each individual panel does not output 600 volts

No one said it does,  I stated you ware building a system rated 150-600V   and yours is rated at 150V...

&gt; My charge controller is rated up to 150V max on the input, but I have no reason to run it at that voltage.

Since your Charge controller is the limiting devices then the system needs to be designed for that voltage.  Further during cold weather it will be higher than your 80V which you seem to think is the limit but is just the nominal voltage.  

&gt; Systems can however output 600V if you have the panels wired in series. Technically you could wire them for more than that

Kind of why I stated 150-600V but technically residential systems are limited to 600V though.  

&gt; Panels 40V each, not 600V.

I think you mean Modules not panels.   No one stated a PV module was 600V but that an array might be between 150 and 600V...

&gt; You want proof that they don't output 600V per panel?

Again module not panel and no one claimed a PV module outputs 600V..   

&gt; I am simply proposing legislation for DIYers to do things a different way and you attack my ideas

I explained several times that your idea misses MANY other safety issues that are much more concern with PV making it a very dangerous idea and unlikely to be approved in any jurisdiction.  You seem to be missing the point and think that your idea can be done safely.  It can not.  I have years of PV design, installation and even trained designers and installers in Off grid, on grid, bimodal etc.  

&gt;  Is it because you already have your own system and don't like the possibility that others will do it cheaper/better while maintaining safety and legality under the rules I am proposing?

No it will not be safer as I explained.   I have my own system and have installed many others and designed many many others.  I also have helped the industry reduce costs.  You are just missing all the other safety issues, even when pointed out to you.

&gt; Get off your high horse. Not everyone has lived a sheltered life like you and can afford nice things.

Wow, assume much?  

&gt; Some of us just want to experiment,

Configuring off the shelf items in the manufactures suggestion method is NOT experimenting.  Playing at best.   But you are suggesting NOT following the recommended install methods, and not following the required safety requirements, and further changing ordinances to make that legal which is absurd.  

&gt; maybe a small plug-in-play setup to satisfy our curiosity without spending $10K.

again, Plug in is not legal...   A legal DIY system does not have to be $10k or even $5k or any set amount but does have to be safe and permitted.  

&gt; Why can't you get that through your head?

You see quite obtuse in your simple understanding of the safety systems involved in a PV installation.  

&gt;  It's a proposal for legislation to add a larger variety of devices to the market LEGALLY while not spending $10K on a permanent system and maintaining safety,

Again your suggestion does NOT maintain safety in any way.  Your continued insistence that it does is strange.

&gt; ""if you can't spend money on a real system then you shouldn't do it at all"".

I suggestion you re-read my comments.  There is no reason for a legal permitted system to have any cost at all.   You just have to design it in such a way that the permit office sees that it has all the required safety requirements, and the utility can see that you had someone inspect it to insure that you built it the way you designed it.  
Doesn't seem like that high of a bar.  
Hell even in your suggestion of getting an special outlet installed by an electrician, said electrician would need a permit to install that outlet (you did know that right?)

&gt; My point is that I'm not stupid.

No just ignorant on the safety requirements and issues with designing and installing a safe PV system or most electrical improvements (evidence  : your comments). 

&gt; I fail to clearly explain my reasoning in a way that you can understand 

No I understand your comments fully.  I am very knowledgable on PV design and installation.   You are not understanding my replies..

&gt; I'm not accepting fault for that as I've explained the same argument in many different ways.

You have failed to grasp that your consept is well understood and to consider that you are not understanding the other issues.  I will point out a few again:   
you need a structural permit to install PV in your yard
You need an electrical permit to have PV connected from your yard aray to the house. 
You need safety devices on the PV side that need to be verified and checked (combiner limits, breakers for more than 2 strings, labels, conduit in many conditions).  
If it is rooftop you don't need the structural permit for the ground mount but there are other issues that need to be verified in the installation like setback, etc.   
You need DC side Arc fault protection
You need to ground the physical array and racking (seperate from the electrical connections).  
You need to have a disconnect properly labeled and accessable
You need to insure you are not overloading the circuit or the MSP
that the interconnect is on the opposit side of the MSP bus from the main. 
you need to get an interconnect agreement which generally requires a permit and inspections.
you need to insure that all the equipment used (PV modules, racking system, combiners, arc fault protection, as well as charge controller and/or inverter) are all UL listed with all the added required riders for you state.  This is all typically done by the permit officer reviewing your design.   
The system needs to have rapid shutdown and most likely a more current version of rapid shutdown which not all systems have.

Just having a plug that an inverter can be plugged into does not insure ANY of that.

&gt; how you think everything should be.

There are few people that know regulations in all 50 states and territories, but there are a few of us...

&gt;  The term for that is gas-lighting.

5th reply about 3/4 of the way down.

Panels don't output 600V?

&gt;Again in the US residential PV is rated to be up to 600V and most systems are designed with that as the limit. Common voltages will be lower but with right conditions and or weather, can be as high as 600V. Many older bimodal systems are in the 150-200V range but 300V is the new standard and there are several 600V charge controllers as well.

&gt; Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the embodied energy of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources.

So to replace those fossil fuel uses with renewables **we would only need about to 1/3 as much ""primary energy.""** ""Energy"" should only count if we're doing something useful with it -- and most of the fossil fuel use is to generate electricity or power transportation.

**Conclusion: primary energy consumption is a meaningless metric that falsely inflates the importance of fossil fuels in our civilization.**

They've always been counted differently, it just wasn't that *important* until the last 5-10 years.   The *correct* figure to look at to see renewable and nuclear energy penetration is *electricity* production by source.   

There are two different sets of metrics beyond that which can be useful:

* If you want to look at the total energy use, the metric you're looking for is called ""secondary energy"" but it's harder to accurately measure and not actually terribly useful either
    * Remember also that different societies use different amounts of energy -- for example the USA and Canada use nearly 2x as much energy per capita as Europe does, so increasing energy efficiency could make a HUGE difference
* For seeing progress towards fighting climate change, the main metric of interest is per-capita carbon emissions.

One other fact worth knowing: electric vehicles are FAR more energy-efficient than gas or diesel vehicles - they get 110-120 MPGe  vs. 25-35 mpg for normal cars. 
    * Electric motors also can generate a lot more torque which ultimately will give them an advantage for trucking, industrial, and construction use. Once the costs drop a bit as battery prices fall I imagine we'll see an EV wave sweep these industries",1593800293.0

First, it's probably a fallacy to judge Germany's policy of the last 30 years from today's perspective. I'm talking about [hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias). Germany's policy to phase-out nuclear started around 2000, and support for renewables dates back to 1990. If you'd lived here in Germany back then, you'd know that climate change wasn't really a concern for most people. Nuclear war and accidents, on the other hand, was!

Second, it's also a fallacy to ignore the fact that Germany could have done nothing. That is, Germany back in 2000 had basically three options:

1. Keep coal and nuclear while not supporting renewables (ie. do nothing). 
2. Keep coal while getting rid of nuclear by supporting renewables (what we've done). 
3. Keep nuclear while getting rid of coal by supporting renewables (best option from a climate change perspective).

People here, including you, only compare 2 and 3. In other words, this is a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma), since you forget that number 1 was always on the table.

But even during the short period when a German government wanted to stop the nuclear phase-out in 2011, option number 3 wasn't on the table. It was about getting back to option number 1!

People today forget how bloody expensive renewables were back in 2000. Germany would have never spend that kind of money to get rid of the coal industry which provides some energy savety, well-paying blue and white collar jobs, lots of tax income, etc. We're no saints.

This is true.  [As noted there is some complexity to this, and the nuclear industry tends to have strong links to fossil fuels](https://energynews.us/2015/02/06/midwest/why-the-nuclear-industry-targets-renewables-instead-of-gas/) 

&gt; “One thing to understand about the nuclear industry is that nuclear is also the coal and natural gas industry,” said Tim Judson, executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, which published the September 2014 report “Killing the Competition” about nuclear attacks on renewables. “Wind and efficiency are just boutique elements of their portfolios.”

Don't you agree it's deeply problematic when Shellenberger's willingly mixes disinformation and lies with truth to try to downplay the risks from climate change?  That's pretty indefensible in an age where we can directly measure the rising temperatures and melting arctic ice?  [The permafrost is literally melting](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/permafrost-ice-melt-thaw-arctic-global-warming-carbon/).  To deny the risks that climate change poses in 2020 with the information we now have is *deeply dishonest* -- especially when he chooses to use bad science in the process, even though he's informed enough *to know better.*  This does not do any favors to Shellenberger's character.

Second, can you point to actual environmentalism he's done in the last few years?  Literally everything I've seen him involved in is solely pro-nuclear lobbying or ""activism.""  Has be helped stop any oil or gas pipelines recently?  Helped protect natural lands from deforestation or destruction?

He has valid claims that are pro nuclear and he has valid claims that are against renewables. That is all that I've heard him talk about, I haven't driven deep into his other claims if he has them.

""Oh look, here's an environmentalist saying renewables are actually not that great and nuclear energy is surprisingly good.  I've never heard about this before, why isn't anybody talking about it???"" 

That doesn't reflect badly on you, to be clear.  You don't have the bigger picture context behind him to recognize how deceptive his history is, or how misleading a lot of the points he makes are.  A lot of the flaws in his points require DEEP understanding of energy policy and technology to follow -- and much of that information is changing rapidly as the energy market changes. There's a night-and-day difference comparing technologies, especially renewable energy, even between 2015 and 2020.  [For example look at how much pricing has changed in the US](https://www.lazard.com/media/451082/lcoe-8.png)

There are valid arguments for nuclear energy.  There are also some flaws he glosses over - [such as the vastly higher price for nuclear energy vs most competitive electricity sources](https://www.lazard.com/media/451081/lcoe-2.png).  He also ignores the way that [renewable energy prices have plummeted as the technology matures and achieves economies of scale -- it is now directly price-competitive with fossil fuels](https://about.bnef.com/blog/scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-existing-coal-gas-at-risk/).  He over-emphasizes the environmental impact of renewables -- which to be clear is not zero, but fairly modest -- and ignores for example the environmental problems from very hot water discharge out of nuclear powerplants (algal blooms, bad for adjoining wildlife, etc).  

Nuanced point: no single technology is a one-size fits all solution.  The easiest way to deceive someone is to mix some lies in among true facts, and to present a *slanted perspective.*  If you focus on only the strengths of one and ignore its flaws, or only show the weaknesses of another, you're not presenting an accurate picture.   He's not wrong that renewables have flaws, but he's presenting them out of proportion to their strengths, and doing the reverse for nuclear energy.  And that is deeply problematic. 

And now he's taking that same problematic approach to try to deny the impacts of climate change, except much less subtly.

These solar plants produce very little power.  Have a massive footprint and are very unreliable.

First, there are not many coal plants in Texas. Most have shut down or converted to natural gas. Coal plants have a high operating cost, that make them not economical. Most of the power plants in Texas are natural gas, followed by hydroelectric. 

Second, the footprint of these solar plants are massive. This plant in the article is 1,300 acres and only produces 200mw. A regular natural gas turbine can produce 250mw on 2 acres of property. On about 10 acres you can have a combined cycle plant that has two gas turbines both producing 250mw each then scavenge the exhaust to heat HRSG to run a steam turbine for free. Coming to around 600mw on just 10 acres. For about 15 acres you could easily double that set up to four gas turbines and 2 steam turbines and produce 1200mw. On just 15 acres. A side note this pant only produces 200mw when the sun is shinning and only during “peak sun hours”. Natural gas and hydro plants produce megawatts 24 hours a day.


The next issue is reliability. Nothing matters more to
An Electrical grid  than reliability. If there is a huge demand for power and you can’t meet that demand your grid goes down and you have rolling black outs. 

Price, natural gas is cheaper than solar for $/mw any day of the week. One of the reasons it’s so cheap is because of reliability. When the grid gets stressed and demand is to close to total supply price goes up. Solar is not a cheap options, it’s actually expensive. 

Also this idea of battery banks with solar is just a fantasy for now. Battery’s are now where close to being able to store enough power to be useful. Not only can batteries not perform anywhere close to what we would need them too. They are extremely expensive and I mean extremely!!

Why?  They are incredibly cheap to build.

&gt;These solar plants produce very little power.

Well that statement is wrong.  Solar aggregates.

&gt;Have a massive footprint

Sure.  Yet there's plenty more land where that came from.  Landowners love cashing the check.

&gt;very unreliable

Maybe you're confusing unreliable for intermittent?  Solar produces electricity when the sun is up, it doesn't randomly stop producing while there is sunshine (that would be unreliable).  Even during cloud cover solar produces a reduced amount.  Being a distributed resource the aggregate total of solar production is fairly steady.

&gt;the footprint of these solar plants are massive.

Not an actual issue.  Yes they are massisve, yes landowners love the lease payments.

&gt;If there is a huge demand for power and you can’t meet that demand your grid goes down and you have rolling black outs.

Have you noticed any rolling blackouts lately?  Nope.  Didn't think so.  This is what grid operators are paid to manage.  How each specific grid manages this is different, but on ERCOT it's through scarcity pricing.  $9000/MWh entices plenty of generation online, even if it's only for a few hours a year.  Oh, solar is actually producing during those timeframes.  Turns out you don't have crazy AC usage if the sun isn't shining.

&gt;Price, natural gas is cheaper than solar for $/mw any day of the week.

You're comparing on a [capital cost basis](https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf) (p.10)?  It completely ignores fuel cost for the energy produced.  Natural gas is in the $700-1300/kW range while solar is $900-1100/kW so it's not even clear cut.

The actual number of importance is LCOE.  $32-$44/MWh solar is cheaper than $38-75/MWh combined cycle natgas, in case you're confused.

&gt;Also this idea of battery banks with solar is just a fantasy for now

String inverter vs micro inverters: I’m sure many will argue but the fact is there have been a few micro inverter startups that have fallen by the wayside with tech problems and I personally consider string inverters a much safer bet.

I personally think this is also true for the solar edge string inverter with optimisers. They can fulfill a useful role in some circumstances but I personally stick with standard string inverters myself

Panels DO vary in quality but it’s a mistake to think Chinese made = bad. Apple make their high end phones there and no-one thinks they are cheap rubbish. It’s all about what the quality control and budget. You will not get excellent cheap panels. However you could also easily overpay for panels if you go “high end” .

Currently SolarEdge has the better backup solution with their Storedge solution and now the energy Hub solution.

&gt; The only thing they agreed on was that I would need about 14k KWH

14k KWH is 14MWH   Also the H should not be there.   
PV is measured in W but generates Wh over times.  
So they are recommending a 14kW system 

&gt; How to endurance the roof waterproofing is not damaged at installation? (I have a barrel tile roof).

This is on the installer putting in a decent racking and mounting system.   I would highly suggest you stay away from anyone that wants to do a comp-out (remove the tiles under the array).  This is a lazy solution that is prone to leaks and poorer performing array due to heat build up from lack of ventilation (cooling).  You want someone that is going to use a decent tile racking mount system with good racks like ironridge.   

&gt; The benefits of a microinverter system or a DC optimizer centralized system?

You have to have module level electronics to meet your current code (there are ways to do it with string systems but they are expensive).   So for module level electronics you have two choices: micro-inverters and optimizers.   
SolarEdge is the leading optimizer system and Enphase is the leading micro inverter system.   

&gt;  Are issues with failing parts common?

No though occasionally ones fails.  SolarEdge has 12 year warranty on inverter and 25 year on optimizer.  Inverter warranty can be extended to 25 year for pretty cheap.

Enphase has 25 year warranty on micro-inverters.  

&gt; Are warranties honored or do you have jump through a lot of hoops? 

They are honored.

&gt; Do the installing dealers fix issues quickly or do I have to work directly with manufacturers?

You generally work with installer so look for reviews there.

&gt;  Will I get as much power as I’m quoted?

unknown.  PV is easy to model and predict on a general monthly bases but one of the big unknowns is weather.  Also some installers do a real piss poor job at modeling (some don't and just do rule of thumb which can be way off).  

&gt; How much power efficiency would I expect to lose 5+ years later?

This is based on the PV modules and has nothing to do with the inverter system.  Most PV modules have warranties of their own at how much is lost year one and then every year there after.   

&gt; What brand or models of panels work best for residential use in FL?

FL is no differenant than any other location.  PV modules are pretty much commodity items at this point.  Some have better efficiency but that just means that the array will be slightly smaller.  a 14kW system of 16% efficiency will produce nearly exactly as much power as a 14kW array of 21% efficient modules.   The difference will be in price and physical size.",1594597534.0

It is hoped that removing the barrier will help to encourage bolder investment decisions, allowing more batteries to balance the grid as the number of intermittent renewables continues to grow.

Today’s announcement has been broadly welcomed by the storage sector, with Tony Dalwood, CEO of investor-developer Gresham House stating this was a “big step” in recognising the role battery storage can play in the transition to net zero.

1571,BecomeAnAstronaut,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"I'm going to use the UK as an example but this is true for all countries (although the summer and winter months may swap depending on relative heating/cooling requirements).

Demand isn't constant, this much is clear to everyone. Electricity and heating demand have strong daily, weekly and yearly cycles (different demand in winter, different demand in the mornings and evenings, different demand on weekends etc). The daily cycles can be taken up by ~16 hours of storage, but the weekly and seasonal cycles certainly can't.

On top of that, we're trying to implement a higher and higher penetration of renewables. This is great, but it has the known side-effect of introducing huge intermittencies in energy generation. Now, both solar and wind have their own cycles of generation. Both have daily cycles (solar's daily cycle is stronger, obviously) and both have yearly cycles (solar is ~10x more available in the summer. Wind is ~2-3x more available in the winter).

16 hours of storage does not come *close* to storing seasonal variations from renewables. It doesn't even come close to supplying enough energy for times of low renewable generation due to weather patterns (which is where the 4-400 hours period comes in).

Some might argue that overgeneration is the solution (have lots more wind and solar than we need). But not only would the required level of overgeneration be insane (perhaps 2-3x more capacity than we'd need with clever storage solutions), but it was also be *prohibitively expensive*. There is an economic argument for 10-20% overgeneration, which I'm all for. But past that you're just not utilising your wind and solar fleet properly and are throwing away both electricity and money.

On *top* of all this, you have inter-annual storage, which is where &gt;400 hours will be necessary in the form of very stable chemical storage. Each year provides *significantly* (up to 30%) different renewable generation, dependent on weather patterns over which we have no control. The ""Beast from the East"" in 2018 had a huge effect on our renewable generation portfolio, for example. To account for these inter-annual variations, we'll need low-power but *huge* capacity stores (in the order of 10-100 TWh).

So that's why we need certain durations of storage. Li-ion is great for &lt;4 hours. It also has growing potential for synthetic inertia (although I will always argue for the existence of flywheels). But it cannot do the high-duration storage we need in the UK (and that the rest of the world will need as they catch up with our renewable penetration).",1594982019.0

Thermal energy storage (TES) is achieved with widely differing technologies.

Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime, storing summer heat for winter heating, or winter cold for summer air conditioning (Seasonal thermal energy storage).

the reason i am on the fence is because while I think a green new deal would prudent.  I was shocked by some of the green new deal plans.  I am shocked by even politicians that I look up to have major gaps in their understanding of cleantechnology and how cheap it is likely to get in the next decade.

I understand if you are adamant about going third party.  I have done so in 4 elections.  however, I do think objectively think the difference between biden and trump on climate change is huge.  it may be because biden does not understand how fast the transition is coming.

1622,Agent_03,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"This is going to be a bit of a moonshot, since it's unknown how economical hydrogen technology will be at scale compared to some of the other options.   But it offers a solid possibility for long-term or seasonal energy storage.  Although prices for lithium-ion batteries are plunging, they're better for fast-response and shorter-term reserves to deal with daily power use -- they get very expensive fast if we're talking about storing multiple days worth of electricity to deal with periodic extended lulls in wind output.  Hydrogen is much better for that role, since you only need a larger tank if you want to store a larger quantity (it scales up very well).

I think hydrogen distribution infrastructure is likely to be a bit of a pipe dream, since pipelines are quite expensive to install and hydrogen is quite flammable/explosive and has an irritating tendency to leak through seals (which means that natural gas pipelines cannot be simply repurposed without extra refit work).  Electrical distribution also has a much higher efficiency than the round-trip for hydrogen (electrolysis isn't that efficient, nor are fuel cells). 

Personal take: we're probably going to see the electric grid used for distributing energy, with hydrogen produced and consumed onsite (or consumed very close to where it is needed, for example in industrial process heat).

Now, solar companies make this look like a great investment because they assume that $20k cost improves house value by $12k. So the funky math now becomes 20k cost to you minus $12k improved house value = $8k/1.2k or **7 year breakeven**.

This is just bad math to hide the fact it's still a bad investment due to high costs. If I have to take out a loan to afford the system, principal payments on the loan will drive the 17 year further.

As someone who's fascinated with this topic, I watched most of it, and can tell you that there were a lot of good ideas brought up. I'm not in disagreement of the fact that Murkowski is trash, but I was impressed when she brought up ""blue carbon"" in reference to Alaska's proposed development of kelp farms. In fact a lot of technologies along the spectrum of carbon capture (from bio to engineered) were discussed. 

The worst part of it was when the DOE rep held up a tile and said, 'this tile, was made from coal!' – it was  def clear from his opening statement that what little funding this administration is giving to Carbon Capture research is going to finding ways to try and find new revenue streams for coal. But that in and of itself is a pretty great admission, they know it's on its way out. Sure, they can earmark millions to spend on dead-end pilot projects, but the hope is that come november, that will all change. 

And in terms of what they've already spent, the reality is that CCU is the closest there is to market viability in this field currently, and most of the smart people thinking on this front have said that it's necessary to further develop this path forward (which is a much more varied landscape than just Enhanced Oil Recovery, by the way) is what we need to fully develop the tech, so that in 10-20 years, we'll have sorted that and developed the political infrastructure to have substantial CCS projects in operation.

They neglect to mention that having a recycling problem in 40 years on a habitable earth is better than having no recycling problem but runaway warming instead where most life dies.

Excerpts from the core of the article and my thoughts:

&gt; There’s a perception that everything made can be recycled, but it’s just not that easy. Solar panels were not made to be unmade,” Dr. Deepika Mathur told Australian media. “As the oldest panels are already reaching their end-of-life, there is a critical need to start planning for the dismantling, removal, collection and recycling phases of management,” she added.

Agreed. Good point

&gt; But there is more than just a lack of recycling protocol. While theoretically, a solar panel’s life could last for 30 years in a best-case scenario—many are being dismantled earlier--Dr. Mathur notes in the same report.

I’d like to see data on this. From my understanding while efficiency goes down 10-20% , most people just add a small fraction more panels to make up for the lost efficiency on older panels.

&gt; Consumers are changing their PV panels after 10 to 12 years rather than their predicted end-of-working life of 20 to 25 years,” she says. “Working panels are being replaced as technological advances increase efficiency and reduce costs of new panels.”

...... wut? Having working and installed solar panels is a sunk cost. Once you pay for installation there’s hardly any maintenance. An *already installed* system is essentially free energy. Unless your space limited, who in their right mind would replace good working panels?

It's what's used to describe the condition of some of the water that gets rejected out of the desalination process. As you take fresh water out you leave a higher concentration of water and salt mix aka brine. You have to reject some of this to ensure your plant remains operational (hard to pump if the concentration is too high so some of the salt has to remain in a solutions state i.e. you can't just extract ALL the water other wise you will have a problem disposing what's left. Note the plants run on a continuous cycle so you can't just stop clean up then go again, stop clean up , etc..). With regards to salinity it's a trade off, the higher the salinity the more fouling occurs. If you have ever seen a hot water pipe and seen white scaling that's the source of the fouling. Note the challenge of boiling water is mitigated by vessel known as effects that are depressurised below atmospheric to create close to vacuum conditions and reduce the energy needed to evaporate the water so salinity doesn't really affect how hard or easy it is to boil. But it does create a problem ensure everything doesn't get clogged up (hence why I mentioned repair/operational cost).

1. You need to be able to pump away what is left (the salt), so it needs to be somewhat liquid 
2. And more importantly,  when desalinating you're using a proces  called reverse osmosis.  As the name would imply,  it is the reverse of a normal osmotic system which would balance ionic pressure between both sides of the membrane. Ergo,you need to apply pressure  (using pumps and compressors) to overcome the existing pressure difference  + the resistance of the membrane. This takes up a tonne of energy, hence the higher costs associated with RO systems.
Now the more you up-concentrate the  salt stream  the higher the osmotic pressure difference to overcome + more salt molecules  means more holes in the membrane get clogged meaning higher membrane resistance and more backflush cycles needed to unclog them.


So:
More pressure = more energy= more cost

Also membranes  can only handle so much pressure difference between both sides before they rupture

Hence both technical and economic limitations. 


Now brine is an issue to discharge because lifeforms also have a certain tolerance to osmotic pressure, and typically discharge brine exceeds that by a  mile for most aquatic species  (it's like putting a freshwater fish in the sea it will die of dehydration).

 While you could but some in an evaporation lake to make actual salt (as they traditionallydoto make swa salt), the volumes are just too much. Instead it is released back in the sea using an outfall structure, which mixes the brine with normal seawater until the difference in salinity is negligible.",1596244706.0

It costs them $60/bbl to make. They take a net loss of $10/bbl to keep running (not sustainable, company goes out of business eventually.) 

To make things better for company B, you would either need to increase demand for the fuel (would likely see more crude oil production to pick up the increased demand since it's profitable) or stop producing so much crude oil world wide reducing the supply of the fuel driving the cost for $50 -&gt; $80/bbl.

No.  Not at scale.  Where scale = distributed production/consumption rather than megaton plants.

The only practical way to get 100% renewable energy is to have 300% of energy needs produced on a sunny summer day.

If peak summer solar production is 100% of needs or less, utilities/governments have no problems promissing to buy all power at 2c/3c per kwh.  When producing more than is needed, curtailment occurs.  This model only allows renewables to penetrate 30%~ of energy needs.  Winter and cloudy day production does not meet daily needs.

Hydrogen is a pathway where renewable producers don't need promises to buy all of their energy by utility.  It lets them dump a 2c/kwh imputed price for their power into hydrogen as much as they want, and if the utility wants to pay more than that, sell it to them instead.  This results today in a cost of hydrogen (including paying for capital costs of electrolyzers) of under $2/kg.

This is proof that no one actually cares about coal miners- they're just a voter base and not a big enough one to matter.  A ton of people- miners, electricians, etc lost work when coal dried up. What exactly is Biden's plan to help coal country? Oh wait lol he doesn't have one.

Appealing to useful centrist idiots like the ""educated"" professional class who are more concerned with having fancy weekend toys and successful investments, will never build a coalition that can last beyond one election cycle (see 2006, and how many terms those Dems that got elected went on to serve).

In this paper **we present estimates of the contribution of carbon pricing to reducing national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion,** using several econometric modelling approaches that control for other key policies and for structural factors that are relevant for emissions. **We use data for 142 countries over a period of two decades, 43 of which had a carbon price in place at the national level or below by the end of the study period. We find evidence that the average annual growth rate of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion has been around 2 percentage points lower in countries that have had a carbon price compared to countries without. An additional euro per tonne of CO2 in carbon price is associated with a reduction in the subsequent annual emissions growth rate of approximately 0.3 percentage points, all else equal.** While it is impossible to fully control for all relevant influences on emissions growth, our estimates suggest that the emissions trajectories of countries with and without carbon prices tend to diverge over time.

To clarify, when a PV installation reaches the end of its designated service life, a utility operator large scale rooftop power producer is unlikely to keep using those end of life panels as they are losing out on the potential revenue of the electricity from better panels. That means they will want to upgrade said installation with new panels, now with current practices being rather human labor intensive they will want to be as cost effective as possible. With labor being a driving cost they will be looking for ways to save a few bucks, that means being less carfeul in removing existing panels, voiding any financial/social obligations to do otherwise. If they aren't careful removing panels, it means the panels are less likely to be removed in such a way that they can be recycled.


At no point did I say that no one would keep using panels past their listed product life in the original location, my concern was for the largest consumers of PV panels, aka utilities and large building owners whose goal is to make as much revenue from their PV installation as possible, in that case they are going to upgrade as soon as the balance sheets say it makes sense, and since those business models are based on a 20 year life span that is likely when they will start to shift things over.

As we decarbonize, demand will continue to grow and the nascent recycling will grow along with it as the panels still have economic and practical value in a secondary market.  The energy expenditure to recycle a PV panel is less than the economic value in a secondary market. Further, the energy output of a recycled panel is greater than the energy input.

 This compared to most e-waste where the product itself has very little value on the secondary market, and the energy expenditure to recycle them is greater than the residual economic value.  Recycling PV panels literally pays for itself.

The market is going to evolve, no doubt about that, and that’s what makes predicting things hard. 

Ex I don’t know for 100% certainty that when a building management firm or a utility decides to upgrade their “end of rated life” PVs they will be destructive. I also don’t know what technologies will be more proven at that point, mounting points, will the panels be some kind of hybrid design, will bifacial tracking panels be better, will panels with solar thermal capacity, or PDRCs be available? All of these questions will create massively different scenarios, and if performance and cost are driving the decision making process a low bid contractor may argue that it is cheaper to simply rip out the panels, and for lots of customers that argument may work.

Without a good legal framework to incentivize proper recycling folks tend not to.

It will depend on the kind of leadership a region or business has.

1898,Pop-X-,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Sure, I've read the article and do understand it. There's still issues in my mind.

First, communicate its relatively technical and nuanced points to the average consumer in an effective manner. Most people don't spend more than a minute or two scrutinizing their electricity bill each month. Framing it as peak usage, rather than just simply T&amp;D costs, would, I think, be better incentivization. 

Either way, this policy would be great from a utility's perspective, but in terms of climate, what matters is overall usage unless the grid is only pumping renewables. I suppose that's my biggest qualm, this could boost efficiency but doesn't incentivize energy *reduction* as much as smoothing load peaks. It helps utilities more than people.

Is this policy potentially regressive? As the article notes oh-so briefly:

&gt; Any one of these groups can point out the very real techno-economic and fairness imperfections in these rate structures. 

Utilities should be *public* entities, imo, designed to serve all. All policies should be viewed through the lens of equity. If you can't afford these optimizing smart devices or ultra-efficient A/C, and more of a cost emphasis is based on T&amp;D, this may make a poor household's electricity bill even more burdensome.

Imagine a scenario with a wealthy household that has all the latest optimizations. Across town there is a poor family living in an old home with little/no insulation and inefficient appliances. The wealthy family runs their A/C 24/7 and the poor family avoids it as much as possible to make ends meet. But it's July and a hat wave hits the town, and the poor family has to run their old window units 24/7 for a week or two and the fridge is going all out. Really high peak load, but still overall lower consumption for the month than the wealthy family. Would this billing scheme give the poor folks an overall higher cost than the wealthy family? If so, I'd certainly be against it.

Incentivize non-peak usage and disincentivize usage at peak load times, somewhat like congestion pricing on the freeway. That's what I'd prefer, I suppose. But I'm no energy policy wonk by any measure.",1597602283.0

Everyone uses propaganda where there is money to be made and renewables are lucrative. “The fossil fuel industry puts out lots of propaganda” is propaganda. It’s not wrong, but its also a very easy way to dismiss any argument, good or bad, against renewable energy while simultaneously making it sound like renewable energy companies don’t engage in the same practice.

That being said if you had some backup then batteries wouldn’t have to have such a redundancy. Just a slight nit pick: coal plants are not a good option for this. Both coal and nuclear take a lot of time and effort to be fired up or turned off. Natural gas (if we don’t fucking waste all of it) produces half the emissions per kwh of coal and can be ramped up and down very quickly, hence why they are so profitable as “peaker” plants (only switching on to sell peak energy).

1966,simonps,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"When you run economics for facilities like nuclear power plants, the decommissioning costs are accounted for in the business case. However, they rarely have much impact on the final investment decision because the costs are many years in the future and are therefore discounted heavily.

The discount rate isn't a magic accounting trick but is intended to reflect the time value of money and allow the project to be compared to an equivalent investment in the stock market.

A typical project discount rate might be 10%. This means that a decommissioning cost 50 years later, would be reduced by a factor of 120 when accounted for in today's money. So lets suppose that the cost of decommissioning is roughly the same the original construction, then we're only talking a 1% impact on the bottom line.

The big issue comes when you don't put aside the money on day 1, and then are faced with huge decommission costs many years later.

When the UK government built the current fleet of nuclear power plants they did put aside the money for decommissioning, however when they were subsequently sold to EDF, the government pocketed the decommissioning fund.

1. Spinning reserve is a specific ancillary service provided by an ISO, and is in no way synonymous with “stand by power.” It’s generation from rotating sources (fossil fuel generators, wind turbines, hydro, etc.) that requires little synchronization time with the grid frequency.

2. ESS cannot participate in spinning reserve ancillary services because they have no rotating parts. They can participate in non-spin AS products or separate ESS-dedicated services. Your gas turbine can participate in spinning reserve.

3. Your gas turbine still relies on a combustion process, and unless you’ve found a way to change a fundamental aspect of chemical change on the same tier of splitting the atom, will produce emissions as products of the combustion process. If you’re participating in spinning reserve, you’re using your turbine and are ergo producing emissions - unless you’re spinning the generator’s rotor with a big hamster.

4. Gas turbines *can* produce fewer harmful emissions in contrast to diesel compression-ignition and gaseous spark-ignition engines, but are inherently no more “renewable” than any other fossil fuel burning asset.

It goes without saying that the reduction of fossil fuel use would be an environmental boon. Sure, panels can be costly but it is as I said, the long-term effects cannot be denied. Logistically speaking, it would take a monumental effort. Everything from villages, towns to entire cities must be powered under the same grid, wiring and appropriate land use would take some coordination on a massive scale. Countries that are adopting this will still need time and those that do not will fall short with all energy concerns due to capitalistic ideals or political obstinancy. 

After all, solar energy is low-impact and cost effective in comparison to other forms of energy as we all know. It would effectively break major companies that countries have relied on for decades and it would be much worse for state-operated energy departments. Those concerns are short term and solar energy is the way forward, no matter how much pushback may be generated. It would also destroy countries that rely heavily on fuel extraction, refinement and importing economically (Arabian Gulf in highlight). For instance look at Kuwait, they currently produce nothing outside of Oil, there are small time farms and even a few fish breeding facilities (it's a coastal country but there is no actual fishing oversight, fish locally is more expensive than any type of meat in the market) but that's it.

1974,TripleBanEvasion,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"&gt; In the absence of the BESS, the GT/G could be “spinning,” ready to put megawatts onto the grid when called, but this practice consumes fuel and discharges emissions while not being productive. Other units around the system also function non-optimally; combined cycles, for example, could be producing at 90% of capacity, holding 10% back as spinning reserve. Having BESS units take up this slack allows combined cycles to continue to operate at their optimum design/maximum output point.

Full disclosure: I’m not a CAISO expert, but know enough to be dangerous. 

Imagine the black start case. Unless CAISO is allowing ESS to qualify as a technology eligible for spinning reserve, I don’t think the ESS is eligible to participate in spin reserve products while the gas turbine is just coming online and synchronizing.

Looking at current views (google “CAISO Resources Initiative: Issue Paper Stakeholder Meeting” from July 22, 2019), I believe the ESS would be able to participate if it was co-located at the same site as a GT and the GT was already running - it would essentially have the same effect as increasing the output of the GT. In this case, you’re correct - it would allow for the participation in AS. In my case above, I don’t think it could - but I could be wrong.

The added cost of the ESS is also tough to justify vs. simply increasing the output of the GT. The big multinational IPPs are also divesting of all of their ESS assets at thermal generation facilities, so perhaps they are onto something.",1598038982.0

We only had a few decades and I don’t feel comfortable hanging my future on a future breakthrough that may or may not come in time. Solar and wind can pop up quickly and it gives them an edge over nuclear, but they’ve been popping up quickly for years now and co2 emissions haven’t fallen by nearly enough. All my life I’ve been hearing about how renewables are one step away from a breakthrough, “just you wait, in 5 years we’ll blow you away,” well I’m still waiting and I’m getting tired of it. 

You’re right about public opinions on nuclear and it shouldn’t be a valid argument but it is. We may be stuck between a rock and a hard place here. It’s not like you can’t change public opinion though, most new tech was looked down upon when it was first introduced and countries like France are 80% nuclear and their citizens are fine with it. I mean even Germany imports a shitload of electricity from France. Germany’s electricity price is double that of France’s and people absolutely love saving money.

As far as Biden... does anyone actually expect him to re-impose the crude oil export ban that Obama lifted in 2015 (in place since 1970)?  How about stripping all tax breaks from natural gas fracking - that Obama bragged about expanding?  Are we going to see renewable energy R&amp;D programs in all the major universities, financed by the federal government (see NIH funding in contrast).

Biden’s just going to do what Obama did - not much - because these guys are owned by Wall Street investors with large holdings in natural gas and oil and private utilties. You think they want to put their profits into R&amp;D and infrastructure instead of into their own pockets? Don’t be delusional.

Yes, there is a rising renewable energy sector - but it has far less political power than the usual suspects do. Just look at, for example, Blackrock holdings in Chevron and Exxon. Or State Street, Vanguard, etc. Or the Saudi princeling investments (all oil money). That’s America today. That’s who Biden and Trump work for.

&gt; &amp;quot;The elimination of fossil fuel subsidies is heavily supported by Biden and Harris in their climate plans,&amp;quot; said Prakash, who served on a climate change task force that revamped Joe Biden&amp;#039;s platform.

2022,pls_do_not_ban_me,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"Most of my opinions on nuclear energy are informed by my BS in nuclear engineering and I am not a staunch supporter of all nuclear plants. I just think that the discourse surrounding renewable energy is shutting itself off from useful criticism or quantitative analysis and I think that as someone who generally is very supportive of renewable energy, this orthodoxy is not helpful to generating support from the general population. [Here is one example](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190523111408.htm) of how we should be willing to question the stated emissions reductions of solar energy. [Here is an excellent illustration](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/business/aroundregion/story/2020/aug/25/nrc-fines-tva-firing-engineers-after-they-raised-safety-concerns/530734/) of how the nuclear industry is under-regulated and generally the community enforces its own kind of orthodoxy (very few people will publicly claim tepid support for nuclear power, because they see any expression of concerns or conciliatory gestures towards their political opposition as a sign of weakness.) 

Most of it boils down to group psychology, in my opinion. When you see things like rule number 6 on this subreddit, or various countries' green parties completely shutting down any suggestions of nuclear power, they feel the need to advocate from a defensive position which naturally suppresses any rhetorical compromises.

I do not try to ""whitewash"" nuclear power, and my education has generally made me more skeptical of the moral integrity of the nuclear industry. I do not think our species is responsible enough to control nuclear fission or nuclear fusion reactions, much like a toddler is not responsible enough to control a campfire. On the other hand, we have a difficult road ahead of us because of climate change and a lot of work to do integrating renewable energy  into the grid, so nuclear power may be a cost effective method of addressing those difficulties while at the same time adding new concerns to the table.

**The basic problem you are describing is this kind of tribal, categorical thinking that seems to take place for many people: any given energy technology can only be classified as ""good"" or ""bad"", and such a person's position on such an energy technology must be axiomatically reduced to ""approve"" or ""reject"".** In my opinion, the problem is human nature. We tend to be very bad at maintaining a nuanced perspective on topics which have serious complexity and consequences, and we tend to default to a state of ""picking favorites"" out of everything. Every person naturally has a finite number of interests and organizations of which they are members, and over time they become more loyal to the people who share their interests or are a part of the same organization and less loyal to the original abstract motivation for having that interest or joining that organization in the first place. It's almost as if most people make a commitment to supporting an energy technology, rather than supporting an energy technology as a tool which will help us meet an established commitment.

It seems like people feel like they have to choose a side, when in reality nuclear energy only becomes more complex as you learn about it. The only tenable position is to support or criticize individual segments of the nuclear sector. Gen 4 reactors carry much lower risks than operational plants. We do not even have the regulatory framework to support molten salt reactors in the next 25 years, and the major problem on this front is a lack of personnel in the industry who (a) have relevant education (b) do not have a conflict of interest with previous molten salt research projects and (c) are willing to work as a regulator.

The community of nuclear people is really quite small, and I think that it is totally reasonable for them to defend their careers and scientific work. Generally the loudest voices in the room are the least educated ones who do not have a great deal of familiarity with nuclear fission on a chemical level, people like Micheal Shellenberger. They just parrot talking points without acknowledging the ocean of complications attached to their suggestions. I will give you an example of this; when people say that nuclear waste can be reprocessed into uranium metal fuel for fast fission spectrum reactors such as a molten salt reactor, they almost always neglect to acknowledge that this reprocessing requires \~10M nitric acid, which is a pH of -1. That is incredibly strong, like ""how the fuck do you safely do this on any kind of medium to large scale"" kind of strong. You need to build a facility multiple times the size of an individual nuclear power plant in order to accomplish this, and then you also need to create a legal framework for the transport and reprocessing of waste which was banned under the Carter administration in the United States. So really you have a bunch of other chemical, logistical, and political problems which are associated with this new kind of reactor, even if you decided to not reprocess waste but instead process from ore into metal.

One of my professors ran a research lab building a prototype FLiBe (lithium flouride and beryllium flouride) coolant loop without any actinides in it, and he wouldn't let anyone else work on the project or even be in the same room as it (only his postdoc) because that's just how dangerous beryllium is as a chemical. 

Various presentations I have seen for the next generation of nuclear fuel codes (especially in the US, but also from some French engineers) have given me very little confidence in the nuclear industry's ability to model fuel cladding oxidation dynamics accurately. I am not sure that we will ever arrive at accident tolerant fuels for traditional PWR and BWR designs, but we sure do love to talk about it after Fukashima.

Anyone that pretends to understand nuclear power to the extent that they will staunchly defend it in its entirety must not have a very deep exposure to the industry, or sadly they do not want to think critically even if they are educated. In my life, I have found that many people with specialized and intensive education backgrounds seem to restrain their critical thinking skills to the work they are paid to do, and they do not want to think critically about the motivations for their actions or the alignment of their actions with their goals. If you want some light reading on this subject I would recommend ""Confessions of a Rogue Nuclear Regulator"" by Gregory Jackzo, although it is not particularly well written or persuasive. He is the former chair of the NRC and he details some of the problems he sees in the nuclear community, many of which stem from cognitive biases to go along with what other people ask of us, cut corners when it makes our job easier, and become entrenched in a position simply because of our familiarity with it. He is also working in the renewable energy sector now, which may make him biased due to financial interests.",1598415268.0

2024,Berkamin,RenewableEnergy,t5_2ryj2,"For some power needs, renewables simply do not pencil out. Consider the Tokyo metropolitan area. The amount of solar energy and wind that can be generated in that area simply can't suffice, and *all the batteries the world could produce* would not be enough to store the energy Tokyo needs for the frequent rainy periods that last more than a day. On top of that, now it is being reported that solar panels actually have a limited lifetime, and are not cost effective to recycle, and the coming retirement of entire generations of PV panels will cause a tsunami of toxic e-waste. 

I softened my opposition to nuclear power for certain applications in light of some of these considerations. Also, more recent developments, such as the technology to recycle nuclear waste to reduce the amount of waste by 95-99%, by recovering re-usable materials using electrochemistry, has actually mitigated some of the biggest objections. No new uranium needs to be mined for some of these current generation reactor designs, since the amount of uranium that can be recovered from waste through these recycling technologies would suffice for centuries.

Lastly, if we are going to decarbonize shipping and aviation, batteries won't cut it; only hydrogen has the possibility of achieving the energy density needed to displace fuel in aviation and shipping. There simply isn't enough lithium in the world to do the job. Renewable energy sources working intermittently are not enough to provide all the energy needed to electrolyze water to provide renewable hydrogen to decarbonize all of transport, but nuclear hydrogen could potentially do this. 

I am by no means a nuclear-over-renewables advocate, since nuclear power still has a huge water footprint, and we can't simply use rivers and the oceans as heat sinks like we used to, since these have on occasion gotten so hot that they no longer work as heat sinks, but if we really want to decarbonize transportation, I don't see how it can be done without some of the advantages of nuclear power. I might be wrong, If anyone here can address what I said above via strictly renewable solutions, please correct me. I'd really like to know.",1598418635.0

Technical disciplines tend to work by simplifying the problem into something that can be modelled.  Which is fine and useful as far as it goes.  But when it goes beyond that we all fall back on intuition, heuristics and ethics.  Sometimes that intuition can be wildly wrong.  But people want to believe that there views are still backed by science.  That there is some objective formula that tells you what to do.  But there isn't.  

It is possible that everything nuclear supporters believe is true.  That the only thing holding back the industry is activism and ignorance.  Even if that were true, that is still a *massive* barrier to success.  If you want to generate electricity then the optimal strategy could still be to select an inferior technology with less political hurdles.  It is more important to generate electricity than have political battles with activists.

Also, your notes about the safety of some of the processes are interesting.  In debates people always talk about safety in such a simplistic way.  When really nuclear can be described as ""safe, when extraordinary effort is put into insuring it is safe"". In comparison I used to work in wind farm design and we had a fairly unsophisticated method for ensuring safety.  We just drew a big circle around the turbine and made sure that no people were in that area.  So if the turbine falls over it won't kill someone.

**Solar, Wind, and Batteries Are All Grown Up**   

Renewables are finally mainstream, which means big changes in the way we invest in, plan for, and dream about our energy future.  

By Nathaniel Bullard  
August 20, 2020, 6:00 AM EDT  

While driving in Maryland last week, I passed a 13.6 megawatt solar project completed four years ago. At the time it was built it was on the larger side for the Mid-Atlantic region; a decade earlier, it would have been one of the very largest projects under construction in the entire country.  

When a technology goes from being scarce and expensive to abundant and cheap in that short a timeframe, it changes people and their long-term decisions in meaningful ways. Onshore wind, too, has become ubiquitous enough that wind and solar are now the cheapest new units of power generation for most of the globe. Lithium-ion storage batteries, meanwhile, are allowing them to provide energy close to around the clock.  

The first way the collective rise of clean energy technologies has changed us? Money. Their success frees up significant early-stage capital to support new companies, unlocks orders of magnitude more long-term cash for financing assets, and has been a major factor in the re-emergence of cleantech (or climate tech, depending on your vintage) investing.  

As veteran cleantech investor Rob Day noted this week, the last wave of investment was often “defined too narrowly” around heavy manufacturing and processing, a poor fit for venture capital because it requires billions of dollars to scale and often takes years to do so. Now that wind, solar, and batteries no longer need venture financing, climate investors can focus on companies that’ll benefit most from an early-stage angel, and hopefully create a virtuous cycle of investments and returns.  

Shayle Kann, another veteran investor, last week drew up what he calls the “Climate Tech Hype Cycle,” plotting everything from carbon-free steel to energy efficiency along the undulating curve of investor interest. On the far left are open questions in terms of technology and market: direct air carbon capture, electric aviation, plastic alternatives. The far right? Utility-scale solar, lithium-ion batteries, and onshore wind—which, not incidentally, have by now attracted trillions of dollars in financing.  

Note: nominal dollars
Another way these technologies have changed us is time: now that solar, wind, and batteries are officially low-risk, we can include them in our vision of the future. There’s a nice example of this shift in risk perception in a recent story by the Texas Observer on the state’s booming solar business. A rancher whose land has been in the family since the 19th century recently leased a plot to a solar developer who wants to install 709,000 panels on the property. The rancher’s logic? With oil leasing looking increasingly risky and likely to be a depleting source of revenue over time, solar is the long-term option. “I want to be able to hand the land down to the next generation,” he told the paper. “If I can make enough on 1,300 acres to pay the taxes on 10,000 acres, it’s worth it.”   
A third way these technologies change us? Scale. Not just their own, but the scale of the markets they could create. Earlier this year my BloombergNEF colleagues analyzed the potential consequences of electrifying energy-intensive sectors of Europe’s economy, including doubling the continent’s clean energy capacity. One result: total electricity generation, which has essentially zero growth right now, would increase by 75% over the next three decades. That’s a huge change in an already huge market, not to mention a qualitative shift in our concept of how big a market can be and the purpose scale could serve.  

In 2001, the world installed 290 megawatts of solar generating capacity. The solar project on the Texas rancher’s land alone will generate 200 megawatts of solar power. This year, the world will probably install more than 100 gigawatts of solar, about 350 times more than it did 19 years ago. Something impossible two decades ago, and still fairly remarkable a decade ago, is now commonplace, which makes a person wonder:",1598440553.0

The difficulty of these problems increases arbitrarily over time, and now 11 years after it launched, it takes over $10k in electricity to mint one bitcoin, and only very specialized single-purpose computers are fast enough to compete.",1598720381.0

Why should wind or solar be the primary energy source? It is sensible to have diverse sources of energy and both will continue to be developed and implemented where each is best suited. Wind or solar would both be good fields to get into in Germany.

As I understand it, to participate in short-term trades like the hour-ahead market the wind producer has to be able to guarantee a level of reliability. If there is excess power and some is stored in batteries the operator can say, ""Even though wind is intermittent over the next hour, I have enough stored energy to continue participating in the short-term trade energy market.""

However, if the operator were to install additional turbines rather than storage as the study's authors suggest, the operator would say, ""I have more power but the next hour seems intermittent. I can't guarantee a steady output of X amount over the next hour.""

They accidentally did that a year ago, and the brakes were too good, 'things' broke, and the nacelle and blades needed replacement.

The locals nearby have to live/sleep in that shadow/noise 24/7/365.     
It's better to be an 'understanding' company that (sort of) refuses to build a turbine that's too close to a residence, and of course you give them all the scientific data on 'why' you think it is a bad idea.

Mouth-to-mouth advertising can be very powerful, even residents where you 'refuse' to build a turbine, will talk to their neighbours about it, (most likely using words like 'honest' and 'not being shafted').    
Remember, you are in it for the long run, maintenance twice a year (nice to be invited for tea and cookies), and turbine replacement after 25 years. (and possibly an invitation out-of-the-blue from an interested neighbour.)    

Setting up 'demo' fields (organized on-request/monthly by a local farmer?), where locals can walk up close to a turbine and experience shadow/noise themselves (and compare to the documents you obviously gave them), is probably the best 'debunking that FUD' method you can use, and, important, it leaves the initiative with the locals.

34,mathew51b,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Obviously I am just saying how things are in the UK and trying to understand how the industry operates elsewhere. 

I didn't mean that distances are set. In the UK, we have to assess shadow flicker within 10 rotor diameters of the turbine, as outside of this area shadows dissipate sufficiently (I'm not saying it doesn't exist). For example, the UK is currently focussing on 90m rotor diameter turbines, so we have to assess all shadow flicker within 900m of the project. If the blades are wider, the profile of the shadow changes and that is all taken into consideration. If shadow flicker occurs over a certain amount a year (generally accepts as around 30 hours a year), then we mitigate by turning off the troublesome turbine during the time when shadow flicker could occur. Latitude is taken into consideration for these calculations too.

Its similar for noise, as we use a sound propagation model in the UK, that to everyones understanding, is the best available. Again, we don't just say ""all houses must be 400m from a turbine"", only to build the loudest turbine available. We have to comply with a noise level at the nearest dwelling, and if we exceed this we will be shut down. This has recently happened to a scheme in Scotland. Obviously, louder turbines have a much larger distance required, all of which needs to be modelled pre planning / permitting.

Your mention of community style projects is ideal - I have worked for community groups trying to make this happen, where locals could invest in the project. There are a number of schemes and methods for people to invest in schemes in the UK now through places like Abundance, Energy4All and other more localised projects.

This is the single most important thing in wind energy. As soon as it is competitive with fossil power, it does not need government subsidies. The governments are currently driving the market unfortunately, but it shouldn't take too long. I believe every decade wind energy has dropped 20% in price!

It is also not particularly relevent to wind farm operators. Lower fidelity computations and even simple empirical wake models are probably good enough to predict power production to the degree of certainty that they require. For these reasons, I don't ever see SOWFA integrated into a wind turbine/farm control algorithm. That's not to say that SOWFA doesn't have its uses. I think it is incredibly useful in wind turbine design. Typically, wind turbines are designed for uniform wind conditions. We know that the atmosphere is actually very turbulent. SOWFA can be used to analyze wind turbine loading in a more realistic atmosphere. It can also be used to improve wake models. As of yet, most empirical wake models are based off a limited number of field and lab experiments. SOWFA provides the flexibility to tailor these models based on atmospheric conditions like wind speed, atmospheric stability and turbulence intensity. My particular research uses SOWFA to analyze the wake of a dual rotor turbine. We want to see if it will cause enhanced mixing of the wake compared to a traditional single rotor wind turbine. If it does, then the wake would theoretically replenish itself faster leading to a decrease in wind farm wake loss. ",1412192865.0

Two forces act on the rotor, thrust and torque. Thrust is the force in the direction of the wind and torque causes the blades and generator to spin. Thrust is necessary and unavoidable but an adverse load as it bends the blade and turbine. Thrust is several factors larger than torque usually. (Physically it is a desired force as well, but mechanically it is not. But this is a different topic.)

Torque is the desired force. It spins the turbine. Torque times rotational speed equals the generated power. A balance between rotational speed and torque must be sought. Low torque high speed is beneficial for the drivetrain as generators function at high speed. However, the speed is limited by the speed of the tip because of noise.

So, if you want more power output: increase torque or speed, of which the latter is limited because of noise. More torque also results in more thrust and loads on blades and turbine.",1413191076.0

&gt;

&gt;The *Windbelt* is a device for converting [wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power) to electricity.  A __windbelt__ is essentially an [aeolian harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_harp) except that it exploits the motion of the string produced by [the aeroelastic flutter effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter) to move a [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet) closer and farther from one or more [coils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_coil) and thus induce current in the wires that make up the coil.

&gt;Prototypes of the device are claimed to be 10 - 30 times more efficient than [small wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_wind_turbine). One prototype has powered two LEDs, a radio, and a clock (separately) using wind generated from a household fan.  The cost of the materials was well under US$10.  $2–$5 for 40 mW is a cost of $50–$125 per watt. In reality 40 mW from a 50% efficient 25w fan gives 0.32% efficiency.

&gt;There are three sizes in development:

&gt;


&gt;* The microBelt, a 12 cm version. This could be put into production in around six months. Its expected to produce 1 milliwatt average.  To charge a pair of ideal rechargeable AA cells (2.5Ah 1.2v) this would take 6000 hours, or 250 days.

&gt;* The Windcell, a 1 metre version that could be used to power meshed WiFi repeaters, charge cellphones, or run LED lights. This could go into production within 18 to 24 months. It is hoped that a square metre panel at 6 m/s average windspeed can generate 10 W average. 

&gt;* an experimental 10-metre model that has no production date.    

&gt;The Windbelt's inventor, Shawn Frayne, was a winner of the 2007 Breakthrough Award from the publishers of the magazine, *[Popular Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mechanics)*.  He is trying to make the Windbelt cheaper.

The next question to have answered, and this is a question that you will need to have answered by your electrical utility company, is how much distributed generation is currently connected on your circuit (connected to the substation your lines are going to/coming from). If you don't have a lot of wind turbines or solar near your property the odds are your lines are clear of congestion. Wind power is an EXTREMELY volatile and spiky energy source that can reek havoc on grid reliability if proper shock absorbers are not in place. Again the odds are you'll be fine in this situation, but keep in mind that without an adequate storage source acting as a shock absorber grids cannot have too much wind generation connected to them.

Glad to hear you're interested in study wind energy resource assessment. I understand the struggle you are having getting a hold of wind resource data; wind developers are businesses that need to protect their property and information. You're smart to be contacting other universities (especially DTU, they're pretty much #1 in wind energy research), because they tend to be much more willing to share their data. I say that because I too work with a university studying wind energy.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to any LiDAR data, so I can't help you there. I do have a number of meteorological tower data sets and some SODAR data though, if you're interested. I work at the Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA. We have 2 SODAR units and have installed over 40 meteorological towers across Virginia over the past decade. You say you're studying in Sweden, so I imagine you want your project to have a European focus, but if you're interested in working with some US based data, I can help you out.

One thing I've always thought would be interesting, but I haven't had time to do myself, would be a wind speed map validation project. Here in the US, we use wind speed prediction models made by AWS Truepower to do a preliminary assessment. I always thought it would be interesting to compare the data from our 40+ towers to their models, figure out why/how they differ, and figure out ways to improve their accuracy. Just an idea I thought I'd throw out there.

Send me an email if you'd be interested in any of the data we have, or if you want to talk about project ideas. We never have a shortage of ideas! Our email is: vacenter4windenergy@jmu.edu

95,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"A bit late, but I stumbled upon your comment.

The problem is that the root faces far lower wind velocity than the tip. Hence it needs a large chord and large twist. This low velocity also results in relatively low torque generated by the root part.

On top of that, the root is obviously the heaviest loaded part. So you usually don't want large twist and difficult geometries at the root. Especially because the laminate can be 10-20 cm thick at the root. You just can't create a difficult shape. At least, not in the wind industry, where a blade can only cost ~10$/kg.

So, having an airfoil kind of shape will result in large additional expenses. It's a trade-off between the relatively low increase in performance and the large increased difficulty in manufacturing.

Enercon circumvents this by creating a metal root part. You can't really see it in the pictures, but the larger Enercon blades actually start after ~10% of the blade. The first part is some kind of extender with the chord. I can assure you that this is more expensive than a normal blade. Apparently the gains weigh up against the additional expenses.

Point is though, you can't just turn the root into an airfoil shape.",1426793306.0

E.g. are they constant ratio gearboxes or variable and in either case are they planetary gearboxes etc? 

One of the key things I'm interested in is how you deal with constant variations in wind speed/turbine speed given that your generator on the other side always has to spin at the same speed. I'm also interested in how certain manufacturers have gotten away with removing a gearbox and whether this is actually more efficient, or if it's just for reliability. If it is both more efficient and reliable, does it come at a massive upfront unit cost etc. ",1433488551.0
107,ayankeeintexas,wind,t5_2qyr2,"If you're talking utility scale machines:
 and care about keeping fossil fuels out of the entire process of mining/gathering all raw materials used; manufacturing all components to their finished state; delivering the components; the assembly process of nacelle, tower, blades, foundation, transformer/switchgear, controls system, and utility interconnection; shipment of finished goods to site; and installation process.....realistically in today's world the answer is no. Aside from the fact that there is a fair amount of rubber and plastic parts, just like there is in your cars engine, turbines also require a ton of lube and grease for general maintenance. 

In a perfect world I'm sure you could orchestrate this, but sourcing every nut and bolt from a facility that used no fossil fuels in the process of making that part would be almost impossible. Plus, keep in mind that most wind turbine manufacturers don't make any of their own major components. Blades...outsourced to LM or MFG, tower....more often then not (not in all cases though) outsourced, gearbox and generator...outsourced to companies like ABB and Winergy. Granted it's all their design and they assemble everything, but to take fossil fuels out of the picture you'd have to do everything in-house. 

BUT. If you're trying to make a little 3-5 kW machine, there is a high likelihood that you could make that without fossil fuels fairly easily. The only thing I am not sure about is the rubber wire coatings and whatever control system it may be using. ",1435027083.0
108,ayankeeintexas,wind,t5_2qyr2,I'm curious to see how they plan to stabilize that much wind energy being put on the grid in such a short period of time. Seems a bit aggressive. Kenya doesn't strike me as a place that has a modern grid ready for that much fluctuation. ,1436247480.0
109,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt; So something I learned (I'm not big on electrical engineering) is that if you have a 50Hz output, that's 1500 rpm with a two pole generator (50*60/2) or 1000 rpm with a three pole etc. You still need to get from your, say 25 rpm, to that speed though and you have the issue that the 25 rpm isn't constant so you may need to go from 1-35rpm say, but still maintain your 50Hz output. 

Yep! This is exactly how I stumbled onto the idea of a CVT in a turbine. Also, the main purpose of a CVT to me is to synchronize power output of the turbine to the grid, without that the CVT doesn't matter. In my opinion, this would require some very sophisticated electronic controlling, but in big fossil fired plants they are able to do this with a steam input, so why couldn't it be achieved with wind?

&gt; I believe you can also skip the mechanical gearbox and have a direct drive to the generator but have a variable frequency generator. This uses power electronics to modify the output frequency - as mad-jabroni alludes to. 

Is this possible without rectifying the AC to DV and then inverting back to AC? Because that's exactly what all modern wind turbines do. The problem is the power loss in conversion. If it *is* possible without that conversion, then there is no point to the CVT.

Anyways, I've been working on a couple of different designs over this past week. The biggest problem with a CVT is the theoretical slippage, and unless there is an incredibly low amount of slippage, the benefits of having the CVT don't overcome the inefficiencies it creates when compared to modern turbine designs with a discrete gear ratio.

A turbine fitted with a very well performing CVT could theoretically be directly grid tied and synchronized. I believe some earlier turbine designs did this but the design was so inefficient it lost to modern designs that took advantage of high wind speeds (higher voltage by turning generator faster, which produced tangibly more power after the AC-DC-AC conversion).

My basic design has been completed, but what I am currently working on is trying to take advantage of high wind speeds by engaging additional generators using the high torque when you have that much wind. It seems to me that, unless you do this, the CVT really doesn't matter. The CVT won't have the AC-DC-AC conversion losses like 99% of current turbines, nor would it require that equipment, but that's really its only advantage if you can't take generate additional amperage past the point where you run out of gearing and you have to start pitching the blades or applying the brakes on the main shaft.

Are you in the renewable energy field?",1437096199.0
110,greedos_speedos,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Ok I guess with a fossil fired plant you've got a relatively stable, fixed load and speed though. 

I think the AC-DC-AC thing is dependent on the type of generator you use - I'm not entirely sure (as I say this isn't my strong point) I do have some notes on this somewhere that I have to go back and read. 

When you say 'CVT' and you talk about slippage - what type of CVT are you talking about? Because there are many varieties.

119,ShaGZ81,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Exactly. Basically, you would need to make sure that the air still can escape as intended from the building. If not, it could possibly cause failure of the vents or blow the air they are trying to vent out back in. Neither of these is a good scenario. If somehow your turbines caused the vents to fail somehow, you would ultimately be held responsible for replacing their equipment, which probably carried a pretty decent price tag.

120,Teelo888,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Once you find the wind speed, post it here. The amount of power available is:

Power in Watts = 0.5 x Air Density x Rotor Swept Area x Windspeed^2

And then the Betz Limit mandates that you can only capture 59% of that amount of energy with a perfectly efficient turbine design. However, industrial turbines only reach up to about 75% of the Betz Limit, with residential turbines achieving FAR lower efficiencies.

My guess is turbines at each vent would make enough power to turn on a light bulb or something.

Also, your drawing indicates that your turbine would be up against your building. This would drastically reduce the amount of power you can capture. You need to have as much open space as possible behind the turbine for the wind to blow through it and then expand. If they are mounted like that, the above formula wouldn't even be accurate anymore as it is tailored to an open space.

However, if the wind speed were high enough, maybe there's the possibility they could produce a meaningful amount of power. The turbines would be best suited to be installed directly onto the vents though.

There is a scientific law, and someone else may correct/modify my understanding of it, but this law is called ""[the conservation of energy](https://www.google.com/#q=conservation+of+energy)"".   In short, a system of energy always has a given amount of energy.  

an example would be a pot of boiling water.  you start with X amount of water.  you apply Y amount of heat.  between the heat radiated outward, the steam created and the water boiled, you *still* only ever have as much energy as you started with.

So yes, the fact that there is a blade obstructing the wind-pattern does in fact have an effect on the backside of that turbine, but the energy is simply diverted into making the turbine spin.  I've taken a few classes on turbines, installed a few, but never have I done ""behind the turbine"" calculations for what happens to the oncoming wind.

Another thing is ""12V-1700W"", 1700W/13V=130 Ampere, you need very big wires, possibly the reason the 24V does a lot better in the graph.    

Do keep in mind that wind power depends on wind speed^*cubed* , the best advice is to measure the local windspeed and calculate it yourself for the various windspeeds you have.

155,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"In theory it could work, in practice, outside the bath-tub, there might be some mechanical issues (something I know not much about).      

A 200m ship is a box like structure with lots of internal supports that can move with the waves, and they still flex.     
This 200m donut is anchored to the sea floor, when a freak 50m wave hits, the (vertical) flexing between the anchor points is probably considerable (not to mention the lifting force on the anchors, if that moves and looses the pre-tension: bye-bye experiment), and the donut could become an oval (articulated bearings like a train-set?).    
You could make a flexible donut (like an inner tube in the swimming pool), but that could create some problems with the 200m diameter bearings (proposed maglev, that works with 2-5mm distance), the variable torque of a 100m high(wind) or deep(water) wing/sail on a fairly narrow base is considerable (flowing water will push a car sideways when it is higher than the wheel axles).    

Added complications: salt water *will* splash on top of it, the water evaporates, leaving a salt crust the bearings(protection) has to deal with, and crustaceans *will* collect everywhere below the water line.    

Electrical generation is maybe not the smartest thing, compressed air (as proposed) seems better, but a small leak will leave it useless, with hydraulics (potable water) a small leak only reduces the efficiency.

Anything with that many moving components operating near saltwater wouldn't last more than a couple months.

Just look at offshore wind turbines. They experience terrible corrosion/wear issues, even situated 100+ meters above the sea level. There is a huge difference between a concept working form a dynamics perspective and one that works in real life.",1453863658.0
158,The-Mech-Guy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Thanks for commenting.  With all due respect, offshore oil platforms in operation for decades have 1000+ more moving parts on them than this device.  I doubt you're saying that every moving part on offshore oil platforms needs to be replaced every couple months.  I think we can agree that this idea is still in the concept stage and years of serious engineering work remain before anything would be built.  It would take a multi-national corp. or multi-billionaire to fund this ... I'm just a working man.

Many conventional HAWT wind turbines have main bearing issues, offshore or not.  The variable and pulsed loads on the main cantilevered bearing are large enough to wear them out, necessitating costly repairs and lengthy service interruptions.  Count how many wind turbines are NOT working in the huge array on I-10 east of LA at any given moment.  To be honest I don't know if all or most of those are main bearing issues.

So the mag-lev concept notwithstanding, why wouldn't train tracks work at least for the upper wind ring?  Super low rolling resistance, very heavy load capacity, and trains already operate very near or even over salt water (long bridges over oceans /seas).  Maybe this device would see harsher conditions than trains currently see, but train tracks/wheels/bearings seem very robust - they've got 'em figured out.  And yes this round track would need an inner and outer, AND an upper and lower track, or at least two sets of wheels on one inner and outer track in order to manage the over turning moment from the large wind blades.  Just add enough wheels to distribute the forces along a section of the track under each 'wing'.  Then there is no single point of failure like current HAWT's.

The underwater bearing solution is much tougher though.  And that's a huge benefit to be able to claim alternative energy production 24/7.  Serious engineering work remains, indeed.
",1453918741.0
159,mrCloggy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"&gt;  Are there other 24/7 alternative energies out there without using storage?     

As you mentioned, geothermal and the gulf stream are probably the only ones, the rest suffers from intermittency in one way or the other.      

If the whole system can be be made rigid enough to survive some really bad weather you need to ask a mechanical/maritime engineer, but after reading several articles ""Promising new technology will be tested at sea"", followed shortly after by pictures of a scrap yard on the beach, I'm a bit sceptical if that 'all-in-one with many moving parts' will work/survive.     

&gt;There is a line on the design benefits page that says     
-""submersible in catastrophic conditions: survival mode""      
-""retractable and/or tilting airfoils adapt to ..."".      
      

As you probably know, the ocean can be very destructive, and this means more complications with ballast tanks and compressors, hydraulic pumps with pistons and position feedback, and stuff.

162,Rocksteady2R,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I work in the solar world, I definitely keep my ears open on the wind - it was a close call whether I was going to do solar or wind.  I'll give your questions a shot.

1)  wind is strong and going.  Texas alone has been kicking ass.  New York was on the radar a few years ago.  There is definitely progress in the field.  I'll say this though - Let's clarify Small Wind and Big Wind.  Small wind is a tough sell - single farmers with 5kW-250kW wind turbines are something of a hard sell.  (5kW is a small house turbine, 250kW could handle a pretty decently sized farming operation).   The real progress is in Big Wind - MegaWatt Turbines in the turbine farms you see on the news.  AND - to lead into #5 - there is lots of progress overseas.  In so many ways they're leaps and bounds ahead of us.

2)  Can't speak for sure, but... I've little doubt it would take a fair amount of phone calling and networking.  If you've got *any* electrical/mechanical experience - start brushing it up.  If you're not - start setting a plan.  I am, however, just talking ""guys in the field"".  Wind farms are huge, huge operations that exist in the office 3 years before ground even gets broken, let alone the tie-in.  You could go financing, policy making, operations management, public relations - all sorts of avenues.    

3)  that leads to qualifications - whatever you've got, start making use of it.  and do a shit-ton of reading and research.  You could easily pick up a couple books on the industry and start reading.  [I'm sure there's a few trade magazines out there - i've always had luck with a basic google search.](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=free+wind+trade+magazine).  Start researching like you did in school - brain maps and flow charts... start wrapping your head around the topic so you can at least talk the talk.   

4)  I don't know.  start googlin'.  do that research.  make a plan.  

5)  Definitely.  all over.  Also consider off-shore - there's jack shit in the US ( the *first* one just got cleared sometime in the last year, I don't stink they're building yet.)  but in Europe they're going real strong with off-shore.",1454979111.0

There is a *chance* they keep a ""hook-up"" or ""electrical crew"" in house, I could see that being feasible and building up that expertise internal to the company.  Definitely overall project management is company-driven, and with a big operation like like, there's probably *several* tiers of work there.  

You're exactly right - after install, they keep roaming tech crews around.  I know *some* of the ones for west Texas are based out of Dallas, Austin, San Antonio - I wouldn't be surprised if El Paso had a hub as well.  I did look into that for a while, but I was coming off of a few years travelling for solar installs, I didn't want to go right back out on the road.

&gt; Despite cool conditions across much of the country on Sunday, high winds and prolonged periods of sunshine during the middle of the day meant that clean energy met pretty much 100% of Germany&amp;#039;s power needs at that time, having reached 95% on the previous Sunday, May 8.

&gt; As increased volumes of intermittent renewable power comes on to the grid, Germany has identified a handful of approaches designed for dealing with these new challenges, including more storage, more interconnectors and maybe the exclusion of certain regions from future onshore wind power auctions.

191,CharlieBra7o,wind,t5_2qyr2,"OK, first of, you need to draw a hard line between designing a **wind turbine** and designing a **wind park**. Two completely different things, as turbines are always designed for a wind class and not a wind park location. For wind parks, I don't think that **CFD** is used at all. Wind park design has **a lot** of factors and you always (in wind energy) design for at least 20 years. The most calculations that have to be done here are not regarding the airflow. And the ones that are normally use simpler mathematical methods such as [WAsP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAsP), which are way more efficient than CFD and yield very good results. The only thing where you would/should use CFD (to my knowledge) is when the terrain is very steep (e.g. wind park in the mountains).

Secondly: **HAWT vs. VAWT** (horizontal vs. vertical axis wind turbine). The short answer here is: VAWT are *never* used if efficiency is the main concern (i.e. commercial wind parks). This is simply due to the fact, that the VAWT blades have a rotational component *against* the wind on one side - resulting in a noticably lower efficiency. To give you a number: large, good HAWT operate with a cP (power coefficient = efficiency factor) of above 0.5, whereas VAWT reach something around 0.3. The [theoretical limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) is 16/27 = 0.59. Due to the VAWT's everchanging nature in spinning ""with/against"" the wind arise lots and lots of secondary issues (e.g. bad dynamics), which I won't address here.

Now, the rotor blades: designing a new rotor blade is a process that takes a couple of years. I can't give you an exact number here, sorry. However, the thing with wind turbines is that they are *not* modular. This is because you always have to consider interaction of the structural loads on all the parts involved. This is an absolutely **crucual** factor, because the turbine is supposed to run for a *looong* time. This means that the structural dynamics need to be looked at (or rather simulated) very carefully in order for it not to fall apart after a couple of years. So you *always* need to look at the *entire* system during the design process. Furthermore, since the certification process is for *entire* WT you cannot just put together parts from here and there anyway... Regarding **CFD**: Forst of, the main issue of rotor blades nowadays, due to the enormous length, is the structural aspect. So you can't ""just run CFD and be done with it"" ;) Like said in the first paragraph, it is similar with blade design. Rotor blades consist of many different ""precalculted"" blade sections (radially) for which all kinds of coefficients are simulated in either software or a wind channel. These coefficients then are used to calculate the actual performance of the entire rotor blade with [BEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_element_momentum_theory). BTW: as a rule of thumb the rotor blades make up about 1/3 of an entire wind turbine, which costs about 1M EUR per MWp.

**CFD with WT in general**: AFAIK, just like [FEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), you CFD is only used to either research physical phenomena or to validate a ""finished"" project. A big issue is, that rotor blades can [stall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_\(fluid_mechanics\)). Stall is a problem that is not very well understood and therefore *cannot* be calculated with CFD properly.",1466331051.0

CFD is a good tool to validate certain operating points, get insight into flow conditions and verify calculated loads. Possible improvements for wind turbines are low percentages (1-3%), just in the error margin for CFD. 

Have a look what is currently published in journals: load reduction for next generation turbines, optimized control and planning of maintenance by use of scada data, park power coefficient optimization, cost reduction,  perhaps some floating offshore concepts and their grid connection.

No, it needs a (very) high rpm to produce some useful energy, and they have a lousy ~50% efficiency.      

On your link the 350-1000W motors have 2250-3000 rpm at the specified voltage, that rpm is more or less linear with the voltage (3000 rpm @ 48V =&gt; 750 rpm @ 12V).

For a 3-bladed turbine the recommended tip speed ratio [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio) is about 7.    
The first thing you need to do is measure the hourly windspeed at the location/height of your proposed turbine (for a year), then you have to balance all that information to get a suitable design.      
From your windspeed (m/s) you calculate the (windspeed x TSR =) speed at the circumference of the turbine blade, and from that and the rotor diameter you get the turbine-hub rpm.    
A larger blade gives more power but lower rpm/voltage, find the balance with the motor/generator specs.

Phones use direct current, DC, computers typically plug into alternating current, AC. If you're looking to power both, you'll probably need to use an inverter to convert DC generated current into AC. You could generate AC, however that would most likely be difficult directly.

If I recall correctly with DC motors, RPM is based on volatge, inversely with generators voltage is variable based on the RPM of the motor. With AC motors, RPM is based on frequency (of the alternation) and inversely with an alternator (AC generator) electric frequency is based on RPMs.

I think if you were to look up youtube videos of, ""fan wind turbine,' you'll find people taking AC motors from ceiling fans and converting them to wind turbines. I believe they then run the current to a rectifier, then a capacitor (or battery perhaps). If you want to then plug in AC devices, you would need to add an inverter to convert back to AC at the standard voltage and frequency.

When designing your circuit, you'll want to pay attention to the voltage and amperage tolerances of the equipment as you'll generally want to ensure that you don't damage the equipment if your wind turbine starts spinning too quickly.

&gt; What would be your main motivating factors in purchasing a wind turbine blade with an active twist angle? Rank from most to least important.

Not sure I can think of a ton of reasons. I'm assuming ""active twist"" isn't the same as blade pitching. Being able to active twist could allow give us a mechanism for reducing stresses on the blades and rotor even faster than blade pitch and individual blade pitch control (IPC) methods. Imagine if there was a sudden gust of wind that maybe wasn't picked up perfectly by a MET tower upstream, as soon as the rotor/blades feel the extra localized stress from that gust, they could use some sort of active twist to quickly mitigate those loads. 

&gt;   What features would you want to see in the wind turbine blade?

Anything that can reduce loads or even make maintenence easier. A blade that does maintenance on itself could be valuable. Now that places like Japan and Gulf Coast USA are wanting turbines, having blades/rotors/towers that can withstand typhoons and hurricanes would be valuable. 

&gt;   Do you think the active twist is feasible and why?

Economically speaking? I don't think it's feasible anytime soon but it depends on how expensive the tech to make it happen is. I've seen some interesting work being done that could make it possible but I doubt it will be implemented anytime soon. 

&gt;   What are the pros and cons of using wind turbines compared with other forms of renewable energy?

Right now, wind energy in the midwest is cheaper than any other renewable energy (at least according to a number I read). Turbines also offer an easy way to curtail power production if there's too much power on the grid. By shutting off turbines you even extend their life since they undergo less stress. Solar is much harder to reduce the power output of. Wind can, in theory, be blowing at anytime of the day unlike solar. 

&gt;   Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve active twist on turbine blades?

Not really sure on that one. I just listened to a talk by a professor at my U who is [working on how materials can be knitted together and then heated to achieve an actuator \(twisting motion\)](http://www.me.umn.edu/people/abel.shtml) that can be used to control how air goes over airplane blades 

&gt;   What do you expect from a wind turbine blade? (what are the basic needs)
&gt;   What characteristics would you be interested in seeing in a wind turbine blade that go above and beyond the standards?

It needs to be as cheap as possible and last for 20-30 years with the least amount of maintenance as possible. Keeping the rotor spinning is also the major point of them.

In a highly competitive market even those last 2% count, but most manufacturers still use a round blade-root that can not convert that energy, and therefore claim ""it's not important"", obviously.      

Although that GE prototype nosecone does do its job of redirecting the wind towards the start of the aerodynamic portion of the blade, that aerodynamic shape is still the 'old' model and that extra airflow does change the AoA and efficiency of that blade part.

Wind Turbine manufactures are notorious for 'fluffing' this number up.  There is no guiding rules defining/checking/testing the machinery against stated power curves, and so those numbers get fluffed to look better/good.

Having said that, there are [calculators online](https://www.google.com/#q=wind+turbine+power+calculator) - some are  easier to use than others - there is a tendency with them to get too fickle about air density and temperature ranges, and a few other metrics.

See [here](http://www.ftexploring.com/wind-energy/wind-power-coefficient.htm). There is a graph on that page that plots the efficiency against the wind speed. As you can see, the efficiency of the turbine is dependent on the wind speed.

While others will probably disagree, I would strongly recommend doing the AAS over the short course. In my opinion, the short courses are best suited to folks who either have a fair amount of technical experience and are looking to get into the industry or folks who don't have much technical experience and are in a big hurry to get into an entry level position.  

The curriculum from the AAS program in the link you posted looks pretty comprehensive and checks the boxes for most of the knowledge areas I look for when we bring an applicant in for an interview. That course work should give you good foundation to get started as a wind tech.  Another benefit to the AAS is that much of the curriculum is applicable to all kinds of industrial automation and maintenance type work, so you still have a healthy range of options should you have trouble finding work in wind. Getting some additional hands-on experience with an internship is probably equally as important as the degree coursework. Does the school help with internship placements?  

I went the AAS route back in '07-'08 but only completed about 3/4 of  the degree. Ended up not finishing because I was offered a full time position after summer internship.  Right out of school I worked primarily in medium scale wind (50kW to 100kW) doing installation and maintenance throughout the Midwest before getting hired on by a turbine manufacturer and getting to work all over the US and UK. After a few years of working as a technician and as a support ""engineer"", I'm now working part-time doing Operations and Maintenance type work on community scale projects (large turbines installed in smaller groups of 1-3) while finishing up an EE degree.  

Its probably worth mentioning that many entry level positions can require a fair amount of travel, but there are a fair number of permanent windfarm positions out there.

Ideally you want to build an [MPPT controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking).    
Using an r/Arduino or similar, you obviously need to monitor your battery voltage, you can measure the generator voltage and current, multiplying he generator voltage x current while changing the current will tell you where that Mppt point is (Arduino?).

302,Bierdopje,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Yeah, that's pretty impossible to answer in a reddit post, and way too many variables to take into account. Let's get some requirements out of the way:

**Aerodynamic**

First of all, you need to select your control mechanism. Pitch control (best, but unlikely for a small turbine), passive stall control, or (semi-)active stall control. This determines your power curve and design points. Also, number of blades and blade length would be nice to pin down here. (Blade length would be somewhere between 2.5m-5m I'd wager.)

Secondly, your blade needs to get the most power out of the available wind. That requires knowledge of the desired power curve (P vs incoming wind), and ultimately you will select your rated wind speed and tip-speed-ratio.

Once you know that, you can start designing the blade plan form. Chord, pitch, airfoil at different radial positions. This follows from the optimum power exchange. It is not that hard, but requires at minimum knowledge of Blade-Element-Momentum (BEM) method. You can also grab a wind turbine engineering book and just use the relations. Perhaps you may even find yourself an online calculator or some excel sheet floating around the internet. The actual rough design is not that hard. 

And, unless you select a flat plate as your airfoil (for 5kW, a flat plate isn't going to cut it), you need some airfoil data. Also, not that hard to find online.

You're probably going for stall control. Unfortunately I don't really know the limitations and design criteria for that, as I've never worked with those designs. Designing for that should follow from your airfoil data and BEM-calculations though.

**Structural**

For a 5 kW turbine you're looking at 1-3 kN of thrust, probably more. That's quite something. You need to take into account the design of your hub connection (0 \&lt;r&lt;0.3R). So how do you make the transition from airfoil to your hub connection? Also, how do you make the structural design of the blade itself? This especially imposes limits on your minimum chord size and minimum blade thickness.

Also, maximum thrust is not the only thing. You better take fatigue into account.

**Manufacturing**
How are you going to produce it? What are your tolerances? Just like the structural design, this imposes additional limits on your blade design.

**Anything else**
Those are the basic things to keep in mind. Later on in the design you need to take stuff like stability, stall behavior, pitch control, and blade components such as water drains into account.",1500460818.0

333,FreeYourselfNow,wind,t5_2qyr2,"There are a lot of responses, though it's hard to predict what a Trumpster will find suitable.

First, just theoretically, it doesn't make any sense to imagine that wind energy uses a lot of energy. Maybe building and installing the turbine is energy intensive, but once they're installed the wind just blows them. If wind energy were truly not energy efficient, that would show up in the cost of power produced by wind turbines. Yet, [wind power is by far the cheapest source on a $/MWh basis](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/). If it's inefficient, investors wouldn't be funneling money into it because you have to pay for the energy used to create it.

Second, MWhs needed to create wind energy isn't all that important. The amount of carbon dioxide produced in creating the MWhs is important. Wind energy is excellent on this metric compared to coal or natural gas.

The median wind energy power system emits about 11 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour produced in its life cycle, which included creating and installing the turbines ([Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x)).

[Quoting the Denver Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2014/01/natural-gas-power-plants-produce-40.html): 

* Coal-based power plants emitted  an average of 915 grams (32 ounces) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt  hour of electricity produced.
* Natural gas power plants emitted an average of 549 grams (19 ounces) CO2 per kilowatt hour.
* Combined cycle natural gas plants emitted an average 436 grams (15 ounces) CO2 per kilowatt hour.

Again, if wind power was energy intensive, that would show up in the amount of CO2 emitted in the life cycle of a wind turbine. It doesn't. That could mean wind power is almost entirely created using GHG free energy (which only comes from wind, nuclear, solar and hydro, basically), in which case it doesn't matter that much how energy intensive it is. Or, more likely, it means wind power is not that energy intensive.",1531438731.0

337,Skiffbug,wind,t5_2qyr2,"The theory behind it is that direct drive turbines are simpler and require less maintenance due to less moving parts. The nacelles are also lighter which has an effect on the amount of steel the tower requires. 

However, in practice it has been found that the failure rate between geared and direct drive turbines isn’t that different. The failures are for different things, but the rate is similar. 

Then you have the supply chain issue. Direct drive turbines require a large amount of rare earth metals. China has this market captive to a large extent, which causes both issues in price and in security of supply. Add to that the fact that most batteries also need rare earth metals and there is a battery boom, and it creates quite some issues. 

As a reflection of this, most major turbine manufacturers that had moved to direct drive are now moving back to geared. This is the case do Siemens (now Siemens-Gamesa), and I think Vestas has a direct drive, but not sure. Their feedback was the point above on failure rates and the fact that geared turbines are cheaper these days. ",1531859752.0

Electricity production via natgas simple produces 600 tonnes of CO2 per GWhr.

So if our 1 MW turbine is replacing coal fired electricity, it is saving 2460 tonnes of CO2 per year.   Given that the entire turbine itself weighs ~200 tonnes and the materials in it use far less energy than their weight, wind turbines are carbon neutral really quickly.

341,cannibally,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Hi, generators are not my speciality, and I just know Nordex turbines by heart, but I will try to explain what I know:

There are alot of different techniques to control the output frequency, it depends on the type of the turbine. But in the most part it is through frequency modulation on the rotor part of the generator by the main converter.

When it's a turbine with a pitch system, the first thing is that it will try to keep a steady rotation speed on the drive train, so the pitch will change the angle for the different wind speeds. This happens almost in real time, and keeps the output freq of the generator as steady as possible.

Then the main part of controlling output is adding up the missing Hz on the generator's rotor's coils. For example: the generator is not yet up on it's determined rpm, and (without modulation) would throw out only 45Hz on the output. So the main converter, who also measures all frequencies in real time, just pulses the generator's rotor with the missing 15Hz, so that it automaticly adds up on the output and it throws out 60Hz.

This only applies to generators with conductor brushes, if my explaination is understandable at all...hope I could help",1532074657.0

These motors usually operate at high rpm and the wind you will find will typically supply a low rpm to your motor. When choosing your motor, aim for one which operates at a similar rpm which you may expect to see (observe others in action). I would most certainly be salvaging an old motor as it will be dirt cheap and won't be horrible if you get the sizing/rpm slightly out of whack 
I would reccomend a generic blade design for your blades.
Lastly I'd reccomend you use your power to charge a battery. If you are using your power directly as you generate it, you encounter other issues such as incompatibility with your device power supply and inconsistency with incoming wind.

As for the RPMs, you could do like what this guy does with his water wheel eh? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=413&amp;v=MAWNPqSvbeY) and add gears to increase them?

I am in a pretty windy area, and our power company has essentially a monopoly here so the prices are silly high for our country.

DC motors have something known as a 'kV' value, the rpm/volt it will run at (higher voltage is higher rpm), if you use that dc motor as generator then you know what voltage to expect at a certain rpm (-ish).

384,kenn0223,wind,t5_2qyr2,"This is generally bogus (at least when applied to the US). Most of the items the author claims decrease the value of a wind investment are either 1) already captured in a typical financial model (e.g. increasing O&amp;M costs over time) or 2) are contracted in a manner that fully or partially hedges the exposure to the project (e.g. energy prices).

This sort of analysis must include are review of actual wind investments by real investors to determine if risks are being appropriately captured in investment decision making. Given the nearly 2 decades and $1T+ of investment by mainstream institutional investors I’d say the risks are pretty well understood. 

The combination of the assumptions for CapEx, power prices, and capacity factor don’t line up. Again, in the US, new build wind is more like $1600/kW; the current generation of WTGs are averaging a 38% capacity factor, and contracts are being signed for $20-40/MWh (plus $30/MWh of PTC for yrs 1-10).   The author clearly does not understand that few projects are exposed to the “wholesale” price he references but rather are contracted (at least for an initial period of time). So to make his logic work you have to use the most current CapEx and NCFs and compare them to what buyers are contracting at and factor the PTC to get the overall revenue numbers. 

Next, he tries to add an additional $2/kW/km to the CapEx for 100 km of new HVDC transmission. First of, no one build HVDC to connect a wind farm any connection required would be built using traditional AC transmission design. Secondly, this does not match reality where nearly all wind projects use the existing capacity in bulk transmission system. Generally the only transmission costs are a few miles to get from the wind project to the existing system and the cost to build/improve a switchyard to connect the project. In some areas additional network upgrades are required but they rarely add anywhere close to $200/kW.  Furthermore, in the US, even the highest voltages (230 and 345kV) only cost about $500k/mi to build. So for a 200MW wind project (typical for the US) the actual value is more like $1.50/kW/km for a much shorter distance.

He goes on to argue that increased renewable penetration has an intervention cost and, while this intuitively sounds plausible, it has not materialized in any of the major US markets even as wind penetration reaches 5%+ of capacity and, at times 50%+ of energy. The only balancing authority that has taken any action related to wind integration costs is Bonneville Power Authority (BPA) who has claimed unique costs associated with balancing their  hydro system with wind. The variability in the resource is managed successfully by all of the US grid operators primarily by forecasts and scheduling of the entire generation stack and to a lesser extent by the use of flexible resources such as natural gas and, increasingly, batteries. Numerous studies have shown the most of the major RTOs can handle renewable penetration of 50% or more without significant reliability issues. 

Finally; he hangs his hat of a return target of 8% which, in my experience is higher than most projects target. Usually the project level returns are closer to 7% with sponsor returns in the 8-10% range depending on debt and tax equity structuring.

You can look at the papers of the people who works in MES department, which is the department of measurements. Usually when someone publishes a paper, they also attach the related data through doi to the papers as well.  

The answer to the variance of the wind speed is mostly dependent on your terrain and atmospheric stability. As it was mentioned, if you have a flat terrain, your flow would be more uniform but if you have a terrain with many obstacles or hills etc, then, you would get much more complex and turbulent flow. The variance in the wind speed is defined as turbulence intensity(TI) and it is the ratio between the standard deviation of the wind speed and the mean wind speed for a given time period. TI is mostly calculated for 10 minutes from high frequency data(10+ Hz). 

If you are just looking for numbers, you can use TI= 0.12 for low turbulence and TI=0.16 for high turbulence. You can use IEC 61400-3 standards as a reference to these numbers. 

If you want to create the flow based on an initial wind speed and TI, you can look at Mann Turbulence Model developed by Jokab Mann of DTU Wind and is almost the standard way of creating the turbulence box. ",1544828143.0

TOO LONG DON'T READ EXPLANATION WITH MATH:

&amp;#x200B;

First: the power of a wind turbine is a fraction of the power in the wind and that fraction is less than 1. Obvious, I know, but it means the logical first thing to do is figure out the power in the wind. Depends on the size of the turbine, the density of the air and the windspeed: P = 1/2 A (rho) V\^3. Power in watts, area in square meters, rho in kg/m\^3 (you can use about 1.2 kg/m\^3 for air density, it doesn't change much and you don't have to be that close) and V in m/s . 

&amp;#x200B;

At the precise second I'm writing this Heathrow has 3 mph winds- let's make it 10 mph, which is 4.4 m/s, make it interesting. They don't give blade diameters on the model you mentioned but I'm going to guess 2 meter diameter, so about 3 square meters of ""blade disk.""  
1/2 (3 m\^2)(1.2 kg/m\^2)(4.4 m/s)\^3 is, doing math in public, about 153 watts. With 3 mph winds (1.5 m/s) that number becomes 6 (six) watts. That is what ""velocity cubed"" does to your power. Half the speed, 1/8 the power. One third the speed, 1/27 the power.  


Second, that's the windspeed at Heathrow's tower, probably 20 meters off the ground. Lower down, with buildings and cars and whatnot upwind, you get a LOT less wind. Heathrow has huge empty runways. There are rough calculations you can do, but basically you're going to get much less wind than the weather station does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, efficiency. The Betz efficiency, you can't ever do better and you can't reach it, is around 63%. 153 watts becomes 96 watts. Utility scale million dollar three blade turbines are around 40%. Rooftop turbines ... well, nobody's ever going to replace one or recommend one to their friends because of points 1 and 2, why bother making them any good?

423,Jeroen_B,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Hi, 
reg. profile: the profile for a wind turbine blade determines at what angle of attack it provides the highest lift, and at what angle the lift divided by the drag is highest. I don't know how sophisticated you'll want to make this, but try googling for open source turbine profiles. Well known ones are from the DTU and NACA series. Thicker profiles are usually more forgiving wrt stall and pitch angles, so don't use too thin profiles I'd say for a small experiment. 
As for the pitch: the pitch can be used to give the profile a relative angle wrt to the airflow, but this is pretty dependent on the (rotational)speed of the blade. Probably good to do a little trial and error here by testing your setup for a large variation of pitch angle.
Wrt number of blades: more blades = more torque, but more drag, but don;t forget about structural difficulties, so I'd suggest 3 or 4 as a compromise. with 2 the stability is a bit harder to control since the rotor has different properties in 2 directions, with 3 or more, the balance is better. 5 is pretty complex to manufacture, so in the industry 3 is seen as the best compromise.

Newer designs use swept tips  Some smaller turbine models are using 5 blades instead of 3. Then of course there is the vertical axis types that are varied in appearance and design.

 Some modern low wind designs can start capturing wind at 1 mile an hour.  General Electric has an  offshore model coming out that is huge and is rated at 12Mw.  Blades  are about 320' long.

If you want to be someone who works in the field, I highly suggest getting a taste of what you're working with first before investing so much time into an online degree just to find out you do not like the profession. 

I went to a community college and earned an associate's degree. To make a long story short, the director of the program I graduated from helped me get my foot in the door with my first solar company during my second year - then, after two years( and A LOT of hard work) I landed a dream job with an industry giant. 

Learning hands-on and climbing the ranks was the key to getting to the point where I am now. There was a lot of sweat, a little blood, and I may have even wanted to cry a time or two, but MAN was it worth it. There just simply is no way I could ever learned as much as I have by reading text and watching videos. 

So, yeah, I know this doesn't answer the question you asked, but it's what I wish someone would have told me before I started this journey. If you live in an area with wind farms, just go ahead and try to get an entry level job with one of the companies in your area. Now this may mean that you have to start out working for a temp agency doing construction, but if you do good work and are willing to learn(looks like you're poised for a good start), you'll get picked up by a company quickly... You'll start adding experience to your resume, which is really what employers want to see, and while you work you can take basic electrical/hydraulics programs from pretty much any community college I'd assume. Technology is constantly improving/changing, so understanding the basics is much more important than understanding wind specific stuff when it comes to basic education, in my opinion. 

If you want to go into engineering, I'd repeat everything I just said. Get in the field and learn what you're dealing with while you're going to school. This will put you leaps and bounds ahead of other engineers trying to enter the wind industry. 

Lastly, don't forget how big the energy industry is. From legal to finance to logistics to marketing etc. You never know, life may take you to an area with terrible wind resources - will you be capable of transitioning to other industries, or are you going to be so specialized that you have to ""start over"" if you can't stay in wind?

I can tell you from recent personal experience that this is likely to be a problem. Turbine techs are in high demand, but you obviously have to travel to the farm to do the job. For development or resource analysis, most companies will have their people in specific offices in one or two places in the country (per company)--there's just no reason to spread those people out geographically, and a lot of reasons to have them together where they can collaborate more easily. The good news is that they typically include relocation assistance. There are probably some more of the smaller independent contractor shops that farm out work to people working out of their homes, but that can be a more difficult group to get in touch with and the work can be inconsistent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mid-career in wind resource analysis (and some related work), and when I was job hunting in 2016-2017 the only interview I got near my home in Dallas was at Leeward Energy, so you could see if they're hiring (they didn't end up hiring anyone from the interview, and I hear they've gone through some staffing changes/reductions since). Otherwise, you're looking at places like Juno Beach, Florida (NextEra/WindLogics), Albany area of New York (UL Renewables and GE), Seattle, WA (DNV GL), California (multiple), Chicago, IL (Acciona Energy US), etc. For the rest of Texas, I think DNV GL might still have an office in Austin and EDPR has main offices in Houston.

Eventually I moved to Alabama for a job with Southern Power (my opinions in this post are my own and are not official statements of Southern Power or Southern Company). Moving away from family was hard, but it's definitely been a great thing over all.

Generally, we have power-purchase agreements to deliver power to a specific customer (i.e. high-energy consumer, like a data center, mining company, etc.) who for whatever reason wants to buy renewable power. We also have PPA's with energy utilities.

These agreements can be up to 30 years. However, the wind doesn't always blow nor the sun shine, so if we are unable to produce what is agreed to, we are required to essentially purchase renewable power on the open market to fulfill our 'generation' requirements. This can be said in the exact opposite side of things too. Sometimes we produce 'too much' power, in that, it exceeds our PPA, so then we can sell this power on the open market, as well. Regardless, it's hard to predict one-way or another. 

Power purchase agreements give companies like ours certainty on a fixed price for the power produce. At the same token, it gives our customers certainty, as well. 

We're required to do so, because some U.S. states or government entities mandate a certain amount of power be renewable. Often you'll see these called 'renewable portfolio standards' -or- RPS. 

Utilities, and sometimes specific companies are held to meet the RPS and if they fall out of compliance, they are essentially fined for not complying. This can be problematic if an energy company, like the one I work for, has established a PPA.

If renewable companies don't produce the power they agree to, they're forced to go to an open market and purchase renewable power. Renewable companies also produce more power than their power-purchase agreements and can sell the excess power on the open market.",1562436541.0

&gt; The developing consortium - led by French renewable energy group EDF Renewables and renewable energy developer Masdar, a subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company - was awarded the project in January at an already-impressive low price of 2.1 cents/kWh, a record for the Middle East and North Africa region.

541,fluxlinkages,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Here are some responses to your concerns, but by all means feel free to quiz the developer:

* Who maintains the access roads?
   * Assuming your concern is during operation of the project (read as post-construction), the Owner. If a Landowner has an access-road on their property, the Owner will maintain the access road as a necessity of operations (i.e. if it washes out, if they bring in heavy machinery and disturb it, etc.). In the off chance the Landowner disturbs the road, I would assume there would be a lease term that would obligate the Landowner to repair the road.
*  How will repairs and maintenance affect the land around the turbine? 
   * In most cases, the access are around the turbine is what is needed to support normal operations and maintenance. In unique cases where heavy machinery is required to repair a major component, the Owner would not only compensate for any crop damage, but would restore the area at the turbine base to the original condition.
* Can we still use them if the company paying to put them up goes bankrupt?
   * I understand the concern, but the probability is incredibly low, and even if this were to occur, a new Operator would purchase the assets of the original Owner and the same lease agreements would be assigned to the new Operator.
*  If the company does go bankrupt, how much does it cost to take one down and who pays for that? 
   * Some of this is addressed in the prior response. The lease would be assigned and remain valid in the event of a change of ownership. Like a new car lease, there is a lease term. There are terms for restoration in the lease in the event of decommissioning (removal) of the project. The Owner may approach the Landowner with an option to extend the lease. Consult the Developer about decommissioning. 
*  Can they function properly in -40 degrees (Wisconsin weather) 
   * All turbines have an operating window of ambient temperature, measured at hub height, where all systems function normally. There is a wider window of extreme temperatures where the turbine will shut down for self-preservation. -40C is typically on the lower end of most turbine extreme temperature windows. One of the posts noted cold-weather packages fairly accurately.
*  Does anyone know any other questions that I should ask so we can avoid being screwed over? 
   * Ask what comes to mind and don't be shy about it. But what I will say is keeping an open mind is paramount. There is a lot of anti-wind propaganda as you are seemingly aware of.

Because wind was a bit under 1% of US electricity in 2007 and a bit under 7% in 2018 (  [citation](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/) ). And total electricity usage was, within the noise, constant during that time.

&gt; Called the &amp;quot;20% Wind Scenario,&amp;quot; the NREL report noted that generating 20% of U.S. electricity from wind could eliminate approximately 825 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the electrical energy sector in 2030.

&gt; In high-density arrays of large wind turbines, the researchers examined possible declines in systemwide efficiency associated with a phenomenon called &amp;quot;Wind turbine wakes,&amp;quot; where the wind speed is slowed by extraction of momentum by wind turbines.

&gt; &amp;quot;The &amp;#039;theft&amp;#039; of wind by upstream wind turbines reduces the overall power produced by the total ensemble of wind turbines and the enhanced mixing can alter local climate conditions close to wind turbines,&amp;quot; said Barthelmie.

At 30 meters above ground, only about 1% of the USA gets 10m/s of wind.  Industrial wind mills get the hub 300 feet up and have huge blades, and generate power where residential wind is useless.

If you are off grid and only need 100 watts then maybe wind will work.  If you are trying to power a normal house (1000 watts), residential wind just isn't cost effective compared to solar.

632,nebulousmenace,wind,t5_2qyr2,"The two things I would say you need for wind energy to be effective are a good wind resource and a good turbine.   


The wind resource is difficult to get, as mentioned- height of tower is important because of what they call ""surface roughness"". The more chunky things you have upwind, the higher up you have to get for good windspeed. Trees, houses, cars, fences, sheds are all chunky things.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gradient#Wind_turbines) has a little math if you want to try it out.  If you're living somewhere that the wind is REALLY ANNOYING ALL THE TIME, maybe you have a good wind resource. Maybe.  


The good turbine is, I would say, even harder. I don't know if anyone's replicated the experiments with more recent small wind turbines, but a couple people did experiments ten, fifteen years ago. They bought, like, one of each small turbine and put them somewhere with very good wind and ran them for a year. Results were [appalling .](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2010-09-16/real-world-tests-small-wind-turbines-netherlands-and-uk/) Picking one semi-arbitrarily (ie one that worked), the Ampair 600 was  [specced](http://www.nooutage.com/a06-10.htm) at 736 watts (at an unrealistically high windspeed) and cost around $6000 . Which was bad enough if it delivered. The average power actually delivered, over a year, on a very windy Dutch plain, was 28 watts. Not a 280, not 128... twenty-eight watts. Each one precious and rare.

T-class stands for typhoon, since the US is actually kind of lagging behind here - the first products where this is a concern are being installed in Japan, Taiwan, and China, which is why the standard is named after typhoons. You can read a bit more [here] (https://www.renewable-technology.com/comment/wind-turbine-technology/) or [here](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1416807/weathering-storms), and if you look at modern offshore turbines, you'll see that a lot of them carry this T class certification. 

Admittedly, T class only certifies up to 79.8 m/s, which is 178mph, and there are hurricanes stronger than this. However, even in a strong category 5, the region that sees wind above 180mph is small and frequently short lived, so the chances that that region directly hits a wind farm are relatively small (and ultimately, that's what insurance is for anyways).

As I see it the ""push"" from the wind on a helix shape, creates motion or torque around a vertical axis, whilst travelling upwards and over the helix edge with an angle to the axis from the wind direction. The other blade(s) or helix coming into the wind will account for some drag. Hopefully not enough to equal the push in from the outgoing blade.
The question is whether the efficiency goes up or down with the addition of anther helix blade.",1386165521.0

Due to the convex/concave curves, the drag from 'into the wind' is less then the 'tailwind' blade, so yes, your proposed construction will work, and due to the up-down slope, it will probably run smoother then a Savonius.   

However, you did mention 'efficiency', hence the Lenz2 reference, but if you only want the helix type, ok, either keep searching 'the net' for more info/answers, or just build it.

* Make 100% sure you understand the difference between MW and MWh, especially in a finance role. You misused them in your post and interviewers will treat this as a dead giveaway that you have a loose grasp on power/energy. MW is an instantaneous measurement of real time power. MWh is energy that you buy and sell (power over a period of time - in this case, an hour.) 
* If you have 100 5.0MW turbines, your theoretical peak plant output is 100 * 5 = 500MW. If you generated at your peak output for 24 hours straight, you would have just generated 500MW*24h = 12,000MWh in that day. Energy is what you sell so this is almost always what finance cares about. 
* If your plant has a capacity factor of 30% that means your plant is predicted to generate 30% of its theoretical max over the course of one year. There are 8,760 hours in one year. So your 500MW plant is projected to generate 500MW * 8760 * 30% = 1,314,000 MWh in a year. Reread this as many times as you need to so you're sure it makes sense. 
* If you can sell that power at $100/MWh all year long, your total **gross** projected yearly revenue (@ 30% capacity factor) is 1,314,000MWh * $100/MWh = $131,400,000.

30,DGS83,wind,t5_2qyr2,"With early designs of wind turbines in the 70’s and 80’s there was indeed a problem with avian mortality, with a avian mortality rate of 20 per turbine a year, this was due to two reasons, firstly the design of the turbine towers, the use of a lattice frame encouraged birds to perch or even nest on the turbines, this has been rectified with the use of tube towers and designing the nacelles with no surfaces which can be used for nesting or perching, this has ceased to be a problem since the early 90’s. The second issue was due to the swept area of the turbine blades, the smaller turbines of the 70’s and 80’s having a much decreased swept area they needed a higher RPM to generate efficiently, as turbines have got larger and the swept area of the blades has increased the easier it is for birds to avoid the blades. Currently the average mortality rate per turbine is 1-2 a year, with some sights recording less than one a year per turbine a year. As the next generation of turbines are about to come onto the market, with the Siemens D6 6MW platform and the Vestas 8Mw platform looking like being the market leaders being designed for instillation up to 70km offshore the risk of avian mortality is reduced even more. The Avian mortality rate is something that has been used repeatedly by the anti-turbine lobby repeatedly here in the UK, along with other arguments such as the mechanical and aerodynamic noise, the electromagnetic interference and the visual impact, the only argument that can hold water is the visual impact one, and that is subjective, I personally like the look of turbines, others don’t like the look of them, it’s all a matter of personal opinion, although I would respect the anti-turbine lobby more if they used up to date data and admitted that their objections to turbine are purely down to aesthetics, nothing more.

Even if it doesn't save much money for the overall wind project, it's one less piece that needs to be transported offshore. 

Why three blades are popular, particularly onshore, has to do with the wind speeds required to achieve peak efficiency. Two blade machines need to rotate faster. More importantly the slower yawing operations of a three-blader puts less strain on the overall machine.

Two forces act on the rotor, thrust and torque. Thrust is the force in the direction of the wind and torque causes the blades and generator to spin. Thrust is necessary and unavoidable but an adverse load as it bends the blade and turbine. Thrust is several factors larger than torque usually. (Physically it is a desired force as well, but mechanically it is not. But this is a different topic.)

Torque is the desired force. It spins the turbine. Torque times rotational speed equals the generated power. A balance between rotational speed and torque must be sought. Low torque high speed is beneficial for the drivetrain as generators function at high speed. However, the speed is limited by the speed of the tip because of noise.

I'm not sure if the increased performance is in line with that of multistage gas turbines. To be honest, I don't enough about them to give you a good answer.

There are legitimate concerns about increased  fatigue loading with the addition of a second rotor. Anytime you add a moving component to a machine, you are likely to have issues. Right now, we are performing an aeromechanical analysis using FAST. We want to see how the turbulence generated from the secondary rotor will effect the fatigue loading on the primary rotor. It is still early to draw conclusions, but it looks like there really isn't that much of a difference between a conventional HAWT and our DRWT.

There is no doubt that a shroud would increase the efficiency even more. It would just be incredibly hard to manufacture on such a large scale. I could definitely see smaller DRWTs with shrouds in the future though.

...thereby, not just assisting in braking (to some extent) but also generating power? ... along with the regenerative braking?

&gt;

&gt;The *Windbelt* is a device for converting [wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power) to electricity.  A __windbelt__ is essentially an [aeolian harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_harp) except that it exploits the motion of the string produced by [the aeroelastic flutter effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter) to move a [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet) closer and farther from one or more [coils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_coil) and thus induce current in the wires that make up the coil.

&gt;Prototypes of the device are claimed to be 10 - 30 times more efficient than [small wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_wind_turbine). One prototype has powered two LEDs, a radio, and a clock (separately) using wind generated from a household fan.  The cost of the materials was well under US$10.  $2–$5 for 40 mW is a cost of $50–$125 per watt. In reality 40 mW from a 50% efficient 25w fan gives 0.32% efficiency.

&gt;There are three sizes in development:

&gt;


&gt;* The microBelt, a 12 cm version. This could be put into production in around six months. Its expected to produce 1 milliwatt average.  To charge a pair of ideal rechargeable AA cells (2.5Ah 1.2v) this would take 6000 hours, or 250 days.

&gt;* The Windcell, a 1 metre version that could be used to power meshed WiFi repeaters, charge cellphones, or run LED lights. This could go into production within 18 to 24 months. It is hoped that a square metre panel at 6 m/s average windspeed can generate 10 W average. 

&gt;* an experimental 10-metre model that has no production date.    

&gt;The Windbelt's inventor, Shawn Frayne, was a winner of the 2007 Breakthrough Award from the publishers of the magazine, *[Popular Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mechanics)*.  He is trying to make the Windbelt cheaper.

The fact that those lines are there and relatively close is a good sign (that appears to be three-phase from your street view though it's a different orientation than I am used to seeing in the US). Odds are you will have to upgrade the lines to a higher voltage if you go with larger machines. This prediction is based on how rural that area appears. 

The next question to have answered, and this is a question that you will need to have answered by your electrical utility company, is how much distributed generation is currently connected on your circuit (connected to the substation your lines are going to/coming from). If you don't have a lot of wind turbines or solar near your property the odds are your lines are clear of congestion. Wind power is an EXTREMELY volatile and spiky energy source that can reek havoc on grid reliability if proper shock absorbers are not in place. Again the odds are you'll be fine in this situation, but keep in mind that without an adequate storage source acting as a shock absorber grids cannot have too much wind generation connected to them. 

I looked at the wind data and honestly won't be able to correlate that to a projected speed at the hub of a typical turbine you would be installing until tomorrow morning.

Glad to hear you're interested in study wind energy resource assessment.

I say that because I too work with a university studying wind energy.

I work at the Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA. We have 2 SODAR units and have installed over 40 meteorological towers across Virginia over the past decade. You say you're studying in Sweden, so I imagine you want your project to have a European focus, but if you're interested in working with some US based data, I can help you out.

One thing I've always thought would be interesting, but I haven't had time to do myself, would be a wind speed map validation project.

141,The-Mech-Guy,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Thanks for commenting.  With all due respect, offshore oil platforms in operation for decades have 1000+ more moving parts on them than this device.  I doubt you're saying that every moving part on offshore oil platforms needs to be replaced every couple months.  I think we can agree that this idea is still in the concept stage and years of serious engineering work remain before anything would be built.  It would take a multi-national corp. or multi-billionaire to fund this ... I'm just a working man.

Many conventional HAWT wind turbines have main bearing issues, offshore or not.  The variable and pulsed loads on the main cantilevered bearing are large enough to wear them out, necessitating costly repairs and lengthy service interruptions.  Count how many wind turbines are NOT working in the huge array on I-10 east of LA at any given moment.  To be honest I don't know if all or most of those are main bearing issues.

So the mag-lev concept notwithstanding, why wouldn't train tracks work at least for the upper wind ring?  Super low rolling resistance, very heavy load capacity, and trains already operate very near or even over salt water (long bridges over oceans /seas).  Maybe this device would see harsher conditions than trains currently see, but train tracks/wheels/bearings seem very robust - they've got 'em figured out.  And yes this round track would need an inner and outer, AND an upper and lower track, or at least two sets of wheels on one inner and outer track in order to manage the over turning moment from the large wind blades.  Just add enough wheels to distribute the forces along a section of the track under each 'wing'.  Then there is no single point of failure like current HAWT's.

The underwater bearing solution is much tougher though.  And that's a huge benefit to be able to claim alternative energy production 24/7.  Serious engineering work remains, indeed.

2) Pretty much any turbine you see stopped is going to be due to low wind speed. I am a wind turbine engineer. I can't vouch for the site near LA, but our sites operate around 99% availability. Availability is a measurement of when our turbines are ""available"" to run if the wind is at the right speed. That 1% of downtime is mainly due to service technicians uptower or main components being replaced. These turbines are supposed to last 20 years. However, the parts that make up that hole will not all last 20 years. There is a very good chance that a blade, main bearing, gearbox, or generator will need to be replaced at some point over the turbine's lifetime.

3) Train wheels are pretty much just a form of roller bearings, not too far removed from what are used in current wind turbine bearing. Same concept, metal on metal lubricated contact results in very low rolling friction. They also mention using air/water bearings. I don't know much about air bearings, just that they need precision machining. For a 200m bearing.

At MAX power this concept would theoretically make as much power as four offshore wind turbines. This thing calls for a 200m bearing of permanent magnets. Just that alone would likely be more expensive than those four wind turbines.

148,Southernskibum,wind,t5_2qyr2,"Well, I think I'm qualified to answer pretty much all of these. This post even motivated me to make a new username since ""fratstar"" isn't to professional. I'm a Field Engineer with the largest renewable energy contractor in the US. Two years into this industry I love what I do and I've made a pretty good life doing it. So, onto the questions.

1) Yes the wind industry is strong and its going to continue to be more so. For starters, Wind led the US in new installed generating capacity in 2015 at just shy of 50%, beating out natural gas by about 33%. See http://ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2015/dec-infrastructure.pdf for more detailed numbers. What you will want to know going forward is that the PTC/ITC extensions passed in December are massive for us. The business entities now have a foresight that our industry hasn't ever had. Historically, the gov't passes a one year extension at the last possible moment within a fiscal year. This time we got a 5 year wind credit that starts tapering down from 2017 to 2019 ending at 40% current value and solar has an 8 year ITC that doesn't start lowering until 2019. I'm dead serious when I say that the people in my company that knows whats up were literally popping bottles that day. I did too, because that extension is going to make my bonus checks look absolutely absurd for the next few years.
Going forward beyond 2019 into the 2020s you're going to see coal plants continuing to retire and nuclear plants not getting their licenses renewed. Renewables and Natural Gas are going to be counted on to replace that generating fleet. As on now wind and solar are only behind gas in terms of cost, with certain areas of the country having them ahead. That trend is going to continue to favor renewables as supply chains further optimize with the greater market visibility. 
Lastly for this point, consider climate based action and the Clean Power Plan. Basically, we're an international leader in everything and we made promises in Paris that we are expected to live up to. At the moment the CPP says that by 2030 each state will be 30% below 2005 carbon emission levels and how they get there is up to them. Some states are pitchin a bitch about it in court (TX, KY, MT mainly) but in the big picture change is coming whether they like it or not. If you really want to know more on that, let me know and I'll fill you in.

2)  Yes it's hard to get into. You either need someone to vouch for you or get lucky. This is mainly driven by the fact that we (industry management) have been burned to many times. Its a tough job with long hours and lots of travel. We've seen too many guys come in, get trained up and then get homesick and call it game. The other side is having someone who completely sucks but you can't quite fire the guy. The number one thing I tell my guys before I push for them is that they better not make me look stupid for bringing them in or else they're without a job and down a friend. I think that's fair considering this is business.

3) This is where things can get a little trickier. There are two sides to this business, construction and O&amp;M (operations and maintenance). In construction, the only time your degree matters is if you want to come in as management and then you want an engineering degree or construction management. I do have a good buddy of mine who has a video production degree or something like that but he has years of experience in the field from before school and he's extremely well connected. I believe most successful people call that networking, so no animosity from this guy. If you want to roll the dice and see if you can start in management, start applying for Field Engineer positions. Honestly though, without any experience or anyone knowing who you are, your chances are pretty slim.
For the actual construction side of building these projects, you don't need to have any experience at all. I don't think I'm being overly simplistic when I say these are basically lego sets. I'm not building 150 towers, I'm building 1 tower 150 times. Crews are set up into their specialized areas and it's like a train rolling across the project from offload components to mechanical completion. 
All of that said, I know next to nothing about the O&amp;M side of life. These are the permanent jobs that stay at the site for years. I do know that some manufacturers include a O&amp;M piece in their Turbine Supply Agreement (TSA) where they supply technicians for the next X number of years. On the project I just finished Vestas is providing techs for the next 5 years and I imagine some of them will stay after that if the client wants to make them an offer. The downside there is no per diem, which is the flat rate daily amount the road guys get to cover being on the road which is usually an extra couple grand on top of the higher wages. 
This is probably a good time to mention that there is a difference in working for the contractor and working for the turbine manufacturer, like a Vestas or GE. They have their own techs that do commissioning, which is putting the turbine online and running it through its shake down to fix any immediate problems. I won't pretend to know what they're looking for because I honestly don't know.

4) I've already told you that to come in as management you need an engineering degree or construction management degree and for field hands you don't need anything. If you want to look at O&amp;M or turbine manufacturers, you can check out Mesa Lands at http://www.mesalands.edu/academic-programs/degrees-certificates/wind-energy-technology-program/ I hear those guys have a pretty good placement rate but I haven't looked into it to much. Honestly its just not a skill set we need. 

5) If you go into the construction side, I can guarantee you that you will be moving around the country. That's just how this game works. Generally you can expect to be in one place for 3-6 months as a field hand before moving on to the next. A note of caution here; be prepared to be laid off. Projects are not always back to back, particularly during the winter months. My company does a pretty good job of keeping the guys that want to keep working at work, but some guys choose to take that time to go home for extended periods while they can. We are the exception. I know a lot of guys that went to a competitor for promises of higher wages just to finish a project and get laid off. If you manage your money though you can easily do just fine. 

I hope that at least gave you a starting point. If you have a short question I can answer it here. If you want more information and some deeper pointers on getting into this, DM me and we can set up a phone call.  Best of luck to you.",1455662527.0

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s renewable energy sector reached new heights yesterday, exactly a week after the country saw clean energy meet 95% of its power needs.

&gt; Despite cool conditions across much of the country on Sunday, high winds and prolonged periods of sunshine during the middle of the day meant that clean energy met pretty much 100% of Germany&amp;#039;s power needs at that time, having reached 95% on the previous Sunday, May 8.

&gt; As increased volumes of intermittent renewable power comes on to the grid, Germany has identified a handful of approaches designed for dealing with these new challenges, including more storage, more interconnectors and maybe the exclusion of certain regions from future onshore wind power auctions.

""The siting of wind facilities to minimize visual impacts to high-value scenic resources presents a major challenge for land management agencies in the western United States. The visibility and potential visual contrasts associated with utility-scale wind facilities are dependent on complex interactions of a variety of factors, but little systematic study of visibility in real landscape
settings has been conducted. In a study sponsored by the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, 377 observations of five wind facilities in Wyoming and Colorado were made under various lighting and weather conditions. The facilities were found to be visible to the unaided eye at &gt;58 km (36 mi) under optimal viewing conditions, with turbine blade movement
often visible at 39 km (24 mi).""

Notice how short most of the replies are to my points. They are not coming from people who understand the topic or have much concern for scenery; just glib dismissals of real concerns. They have bought into the green mythology surrounding these over-sized machines that already number over 250,000 planet-wide; intended to expand to several million.

167,CharlieBra7o,wind,t5_2qyr2,"OK, first of, you need to draw a hard line between designing a **wind turbine** and designing a **wind park**. Two completely different things, as turbines are always designed for a wind class and not a wind park location. For wind parks, I don't think that **CFD** is used at all. Wind park design has **a lot** of factors and you always (in wind energy) design for at least 20 years. The most calculations that have to be done here are not regarding the airflow. And the ones that are normally use simpler mathematical methods such as [WAsP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAsP), which are way more efficient than CFD and yield very good results. The only thing where you would/should use CFD (to my knowledge) is when the terrain is very steep (e.g. wind park in the mountains).

Secondly: **HAWT vs. VAWT** (horizontal vs. vertical axis wind turbine). The short answer here is: VAWT are *never* used if efficiency is the main concern (i.e. commercial wind parks). This is simply due to the fact, that the VAWT blades have a rotational component *against* the wind on one side - resulting in a noticably lower efficiency. To give you a number: large, good HAWT operate with a cP (power coefficient = efficiency factor) of above 0.5, whereas VAWT reach something around 0.3. The [theoretical limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) is 16/27 = 0.59. Due to the VAWT's everchanging nature in spinning ""with/against"" the wind arise lots and lots of secondary issues (e.g. bad dynamics), which I won't address here.

Now, the rotor blades: designing a new rotor blade is a process that takes a couple of years. I can't give you an exact number here, sorry. However, the thing with wind turbines is that they are *not* modular. This is because you always have to consider interaction of the structural loads on all the parts involved. This is an absolutely **crucual** factor, because the turbine is supposed to run for a *looong* time. This means that the structural dynamics need to be looked at (or rather simulated) very carefully in order for it not to fall apart after a couple of years. So you *always* need to look at the *entire* system during the design process. Furthermore, since the certification process is for *entire* WT you cannot just put together parts from here and there anyway... Regarding **CFD**: Forst of, the main issue of rotor blades nowadays, due to the enormous length, is the structural aspect. So you can't ""just run CFD and be done with it"" ;) Like said in the first paragraph, it is similar with blade design. Rotor blades consist of many different ""precalculted"" blade sections (radially) for which all kinds of coefficients are simulated in either software or a wind channel. These coefficients then are used to calculate the actual performance of the entire rotor blade with [BEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_element_momentum_theory). BTW: as a rule of thumb the rotor blades make up about 1/3 of an entire wind turbine, which costs about 1M EUR per MWp.

**CFD with WT in general**: AFAIK, just like [FEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), you CFD is only used to either research physical phenomena or to validate a ""finished"" project. A big issue is, that rotor blades can [stall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_\(fluid_mechanics\)). Stall is a problem that is not very well understood and therefore *cannot* be calculated with CFD properly.",1466331051.0

That's like justifying a goal of pasturing 400,000 head of cattle in Manhattan by saying ""well look there are 98.4 million head in the us. 400,000 isn't very much.""


&gt;And economically, it does make sense. Offshore is getting cheaper, and offering this sort of long-term commitment is just what's needed to give investors some certainty: and that translates into lower costs and inward investment in manufacturing capability.

Offshore is getting a bit cheaper, but solar is getting cheaper faster. Offshore operation costs are pretty high, and the power prices in Europe at the best sites are at the 100 euro/MWH sort of level these days.  That's below retail prices for power in the US, but probably doesn't give enough profit at current prices to justify a couple billion dollars of investment.  So like I said, I'm not opposed to offshore, it'll probably make sense at some point.  But I don't think it makes sense in the 5-10 year time frame in the US.

187,FiniteEarth,wind,t5_2qyr2,"No, offshore wind isn't completely different. Look at the visual impact of the Block Island array off Rhode Island (America's first attempt at sullying the ocean). Look at the battle that killed Cape Wind, MA, and so on. Your link shows some ideal situations that are economically impractical in many cases. Even if the turbines are 20 miles from one point they may be closer to another, and elevation of the viewing angle is a factor. 20 miles is not a hard limit for visibility. 

From: http://visualimpact.anl.gov/windvitd/

""The facilities were found to be visible to the unaided eye at &gt;36 mi (58 km) under optimal viewing conditions, with turbine blade movement often visible at 24 mi (39 km). Under favorable viewing conditions, the wind facilities were judged to be major foci of visual attention at up to 12 mi (19 km) and were likely to be noticed by casual observers at &gt;23 mi (37 km). A conservative interpretation suggests that for such facilities, an appropriate radius for visual impact analyses would be 30 mi (48 km), that the facilities would be unlikely to be missed by casual observers at distances of up to 20 mi (32 km), and that the facilities could be major sources of visual contrast at distances of up to 10 mi (16 km).""

There's also the matter of red lights flashing at night, which can cut through those distances. And ships will need to avoid more and more junk in the water. You have to admit that it's all part of the same industrial continuum. The sheer numbers of these machines needed to make much difference is staggering. A pipe-dreamer named Jacobson from Stanford came up with ""3.8 million large wind turbines"" and proposed that many of them be offshore, but just getting a few dozen or a hundred installed meets plenty of resistance. Pro wind power arguments routinely cite absolute best case scenarios in terms of ""careful siting,"" noise, bird/bat kills and many other factors. It's time for people to stop blindly accepting those claims just because the machines don't directly emit fumes. That's really all that's green about them.",1474590470.0

If you look at the Siemens 2.3 MW geared models, the older towers have the bullet shaped nose cone, while newer ones have the flat front (you actually have a Siemens direct-drive pictured, not the same thing).

193,Spanks_Hippos,wind,t5_2qyr2,"I'm just a Ph.D. student for turbine control systems but I've climbed a couple of turbines and study blades alot: 

&gt; What would be your main motivating factors in purchasing a wind turbine blade with an active twist angle? Rank from most to least important.

Not sure I can think of a ton of reasons. I'm assuming ""active twist"" isn't the same as blade pitching. Being able to active twist could allow give us a mechanism for reducing stresses on the blades and rotor even faster than blade pitch and individual blade pitch control (IPC) methods. Imagine if there was a sudden gust of wind that maybe wasn't picked up perfectly by a MET tower upstream, as soon as the rotor/blades feel the extra localized stress from that gust, they could use some sort of active twist to quickly mitigate those loads. 

&gt;   What features would you want to see in the wind turbine blade?

Anything that can reduce loads or even make maintenence easier. A blade that does maintenance on itself could be valuable. Now that places like Japan and Gulf Coast USA are wanting turbines, having blades/rotors/towers that can withstand typhoons and hurricanes would be valuable. 

&gt;   Do you think the active twist is feasible and why?

Economically speaking? I don't think it's feasible anytime soon but it depends on how expensive the tech to make it happen is. I've seen some interesting work being done that could make it possible but I doubt it will be implemented anytime soon. 

&gt;   What are the pros and cons of using wind turbines compared with other forms of renewable energy?

Right now, wind energy in the midwest is cheaper than any other renewable energy (at least according to a number I read). Turbines also offer an easy way to curtail power production if there's too much power on the grid. By shutting off turbines you even extend their life since they undergo less stress. Solar is much harder to reduce the power output of. Wind can, in theory, be blowing at anytime of the day unlike solar. 

&gt;   Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve active twist on turbine blades?

Not really sure on that one. I just listened to a talk by a professor at my U who is [working on how materials can be knitted together and then heated to achieve an actuator \(twisting motion\)](http://www.me.umn.edu/people/abel.shtml) that can be used to control how air goes over airplane blades 

&gt;   What do you expect from a wind turbine blade? (what are the basic needs)
&gt;   What characteristics would you be interested in seeing in a wind turbine blade that go above and beyond the standards?

It needs to be as cheap as possible and last for 20-30 years with the least amount of maintenance as possible. Keeping the rotor spinning is also the major point of them. 

Interested in seeing what you make of this. good luck. ",1476592956.0

well, i take it a few ways..... yes, usually when things like this happen it's due to some insider stuff.

Someone is bleeding money out somewhere... whether they're bleeding it out and keeping it or whether they're just hemorrhaging it on stupid shit... is where an internal audit will help to reveal.... it's really just a matter of how much paperwork and what not is....  I'd imagine the government, functioning properly, would put a lot of pressure on them to figure out where it went... but....

... if it *is* politically motivated or some other aspect... say... some insider pulling out cash on things to bleed the project to a *non*-success... or just spending cash up for a non-success... and getting paid on the outside...

I see it like this: it's not whether or not this specific incarnation of the technology was financially profitable or not... well, at massive levels anyway... break even would be at least necessary.... it's... *if* it works... then it works.... and then it can be perfected in future revisions of the project as it expands... I'll come back to this...
i'll finish my conspiracy theory first.... if this works, and I stand convinced that the base technology and concept itself will... not only work, but will also work economically and can be made even cheaper in future designs... then .... it's not just a matter of going 20 million gallons a year like the one plant showed, or 10% 20% or even 30%  blend with gasoline, it has the capability to replace gasoline.... because if it works with mixed feedstocks like wood chips and the other things they were mentioning... it will work even better with controlled/specific feedstocks... like corn or switchgrass, etc.... because you can focus the equipment on the more specific and predictable gases produced from the specific feedstocks...

... but if it can work on those land-based ones, it will *also* work on sea/water based ones like algae... 

...and, it honestly goes one farther than that... it will work essentially on *any* hydrocarbon feedstock... from from biomass to coal to tar(sands) on .... which it's already been proven to...

... but i don't see any of those as being anywhere near a threat as biomass... fore it's the only one of those that's actually renewable and can be .... can set up supply chains around

... and, if it works on those... petroleum loses it's crown as the head transportation fuel.   ....so, it becomes very worthwhile, from the perspective of petroleum, to ensure that this *doesn't* happen... this nor *any* project *like* this ever be shown to be even somewhat successful... 
it reminds me of the old [Atari game Tempest](http://my.ign.com/atari/tempest)... it's about the simplest example of it that I can think of... you kill the little bastards as soon as they show their heads... and if none are, you spin around and fire off shots anyway just to have 'bullets' going their just *in case* they even *think* about sending one up the path it'll start getting hit right out the gate (wow i just got stuck playing that for like 5 minutes)

probably not in this case, the more i read about it, the more i get the general idea that they just didn't have it but... $160m is a lot of money, like you said... if they *didn't* get it, it seems like they'd've at least figured out *something* about it to get it in a future deal... maybe not but....

so, conspiracy or not, obviously 'they' don't want to see it work.... it just capitalistically doesn't make sense for the competition to want ... their competition to thrive... and the only caes where it's happened is... in the case of ethanol... where...  (which is why this half had a shot).... where the 'allowance' of ethanol on the one hand looks like 'yeah! the bio-guys/renewables/greenies/whatevers are taking a piece out of petroleum!'   when in a step back there are multiple negatives to it... 

1) ethanol is 85% the energy density per volume of gasoline, so the inclusion of it *lowers* fuel economy.. ie, more fill-ups

2) ethanol mandates ... mandate that ethanol be used... and this means that ethanol *has* to exist... and, since the mandates are 7% right now.. that's great right? no. because that means that 93% has to come from somewhere else... ie, petroleum.... so this not only ties up the dependency on petroleum even farther, it also now overlaps its interests with not just the corn lobby specifically, but the agriculture lobby in general... because all of those farmers now are completely dependent on growing corn so... if gas fails, then ethanol-from-corn fails and thus ag fails, and thus.... you get the idea..

3) it creates a bottom pricing point for petroleum. If you *have* to use 7% ethanol, and ethanol can only be made for $3 a gallon, then you *know* that at least 7% of the fuel has to cost $3 a gallon to go into the car... even farther than that though... it means that petroleum suppliers are going to *know* that they have a bottom for ethanol and thus a point where they can also keep their prices relative to... this also opens u availability for moe expensive petroleum... ie, the stuff that costs $x a gallon such that it would be turned into $3 a gallon gasoline.... the drilling industry loves this obv... as well as the refinery companies, etc etc

4) ethanol is grown from corn which requires nitrogen fertilizer which is gotten from a.... how far have people gotten with 'organic' food? far enough that it's sold most places but.. even organic-labeled food ... all that means is that it was grown organically, it can still be grown from GMO'd seed... it just has to be organic ... and, at that, organic costs more... the only reason organic has gotten anywhere is because people will pay more for it thinking that it's better for them (it may be, it may not be, i'll let you debate that one, but for my point it matters not).... imagine the price of that organic if the organic then had to compete with 'organic' fuel.... meaning, no one cares if the corn based ethanol in their car is gmo'd or not. organicly grown or not... if it were, it'd only cost more.  this leads me to my next point... it's not... which means that it gets its fertilizer from non-organic places... and, where they say 'fossil fuel-based' fertilizers, what they basically mean is ammonia derived from the n.gas clean up process (little to no ammonia (read: nitrogen) comes from the petroleum refinement process).... and how do you get n.gas? you drill for it. how do you get oil? you drill for it. this means that the 'drilling lobbyists' are now incentivized to push these... as well, if we're ethanol dependent then we're corn dependent. and if we're corn dependent then we're nitrogen-fertilizer dependent... and if we're nitrogen fertilizer dependent then we're n.gas dependent and if we're n.gas dependent then we're drilling dependent... and if we're drilling dependent then we have continued support for not just existing drilling technology, but advancements in drilling technology.... the type of advancements that make it cheaper to drill that as-of-now more expensive oil to drill.... 

... but as technology develops, oil, n.gas, etc extraction get cheaper and ... well, the trick? increase the dependency on ethanol to support it all... 7% moves to 17% to 27% and so on still means we need yet more of the other... places... this is, of course, from the perspective of 'other' feedstocks...

in the case of this, build in the 'profit' margins.. and then use the profits to buy yet more of the competition's capability... that means, in the case of fossil fuels... the ability to buy yet more coal mines, more tar sands, etc... you can shift over the profits from the one to buying higher percentages of the other... that way you can align its interests behind yours...

eventually mining technology gets replaced with drilling technology, and, instead of mining coal, you're drilling into it and creating the infrastructure for underground coal gasification... this brings the gas out... w/out really advancing gasification technology in any major way ... and then the gas produced gets burned as a n.gas substitute. but, you don't want to do this at the expense of your n.gas wells... so you.. do it to 'compliment' them... ie, you make it cost just a nudge more than the n.gas so that it becomes n.gas-derived-methane blended with a 7% ratio of 'clean coal' from coal gasification... insert the same feedback loop as above...  tar sands are basically the same... 

but you only allow gasification and syngas-cleanup technology to advance to allow for this at a controlled rate.. this means you own the companies that develop the technology... at least the ones your bought-and-paid for lobbyists push-convince the government to grant grants, subsidies, tax breaks to... etc etc.... which you can afford, quite simply, because you have those profits you generate from it... and the money.. that the up-and-comer doesn't have...

and then the up-and-comer is faced with a dilemma... accept the 'pay off' money and live a comfortable lifestyle... walking away or going along to get along... or... fight an uphill battle with countless points of contention while attempting to go against the others that have money... at the same time running countless marketing campaigns to convince people to *not* like that approach... if all else fails, pay off senators congressmen etc to put pressure on the IRS to audit those companies books... osha agents to police them, or, out of yet more desperation, buy property around them and call up and complain of noises, smells, etc etc... anything to harass them into being so f'ing annoyed and stressed the project fails.... 

this is a long point, and really is multiple points kind of wrapped under one number

4) in order to qualify for grants, subsidies, tax breaks, loans etc.... they all fall under 'ethanol' producers... this is where the government has focused their ... incentives.

Ethanol may *not* be the best or most-natural hydrocarbon chain for these feedstocks. They may better produce other hydrocarbon chain-lengths... they may not even make ethanol, they may make ethane, butane, propane, methane... raw hydrogen even... let alone longer ones... and then need to be farther broken down in order to be restepped back into ethanol... all of this requires more energy, technology etc...  but, since ethanol is what we're using as a biofuel gasoline additive/replacement... it's where the focus needs to be... it's where the business model and technological approach has to be geared towards in order to qualify for these....

as is, anaerobic digestion seems the cheaper and easier path towards this... and... well.... this leads be back to the other thing i forgot to add in point 3)...

the gasification technology is where I see the real breakthroughs as happening.... lowering costs of these.. not just in manufacturing the designs themselves, but also in the costs to run them... insulation, mechanics, temperature monitoring and zone-control, etc lie on the mechanical cost side... but as well these increase the efficiency of the unit and, thus , decrease the energy and labor and what not else needed to run the process.

the point after this comes into two other main points of focus... three actually... 1) feedstocks themselves (switchgrass, miscanthus, etc seem to be much more hydrocarbon dense than... corn stover or even just wood chips in general...) 2) this is the gasification tech point and already covered 3) gas clean up/filtration and sorting technologies 4) advancement in the catalysts utilized in the Fischer-Tropsch process, or similar process-types, that convert the gases produced into more usable fuel types.... again, forcing it to produce ethanol may not be natural... but it may *need* to produce ethanol in order to qualify for those financial incentives and programs.

All of this is relatively easy to bottle up... if it's patentable either don't license out the patents and develop the technology in house but charge through the roof for it, if it's *not* patentable ... hide the discoveries as best as possible... fund more-public universities and research labs down *other* paths... away from these, or down the 'wrong' paths that will produce something similar but *not* what these are...  put pressure on the peer-review process as well... fund other things vs these things... etc etc.

the other thing was... own the equipment suppliers. or the manufacturers of the equipment, or the points of focus that allow the equipment to be manufactured... labor, resources, etc... hisimply 'hire-them-away'

back to point 1) growth of feedstocks.... well, the more fertilizer required to grow the crops...the higher the costs, the 'deader' the soil becomes... the less productive, the thinner the margins, etc... the higher the likelihood that the farm can financially support itself... sue the farm if it's growing competitive *non*-gmo'd seeds for selling gmo'd products by.... well... tainting the feedstock... this could be as simple as paying a driver to purposefully spill a truckload of seed alongside the field to more invasively paying guys to go through the field shortly after planting to intermix non-licensed gmo seeds into the field to grow alongside the normal feedstock ... information from insurance companies for farm insurance and what not can procure the information that would allow the seed-type grown by the farmer... if not just straight going into the field and digging up a few seeds after planting and running tests on it to figure it out the harder way... plant similar looking but different strains... then have the feedstock questioned on it's authenticity... and, if the farmer is growing or shown to be growing something that isn't licensed for them... even if it's not known by the farmer that they are... you sue the ever living shit out of them *that* way and... well, buy the farm at auction.

the more farms you own, the more you can control the feedstocks grown.... the point is, .. back to the Tempest analogy... destroy them before they even have a chance to get out of the gate... and, unlike Tempest... you can hire multiple 'shooters' or lobbyists or saboteurs etc to do this than just the one 'gun' allowed in the game... the more you win, the more profits you can make and the more 'guns' you can afford to hire to keep it all under wraps.

A bit extreme? yes, of course. beyond the realm of imagination? obviously not... beyond the realm of likelihood? .... nah, i mean, hell, if I were making that kind of money, stood to make that much more, and already had a lot to begin with... i'd probably do it... and would morally and ethically justify it to myself... karma is a state of mind anyway.... and you can afford a lot of states of mind or clean consciences with that much money. ...hell, there may not be anything wrong with it to begin with... a lot of it is questionably illegal to begin with


but.... more to the likelihood of what it reads like... 

Lately I've been going through refinement processes, diagrams, technologies, approaches, etc in the petroleum industry. It's really interesting to watch how these things develop, evolve, revolve even.... looking at a lot of the approaches, these companies don't just put forth the plans and schematics, they *brag* about their approaches... their new refineries, processes, it's a bragging right to them... put the diagrams and flow charts up, advertise the patents even, throw ceremonies, talks, etc about it.

with all of that... these things have been evolving for over a century. It's.... each version of it releases a new approach of sort. Some of them are simply the same basic design with newer pieces swapped out for older ones, other designs are near complete reapproaches to it.... and even those evolve as the project expands.

Some refineries may have multiple different sub-refineries on site.... swapping out one for another... and then replacing the next 'module' with another even more evolved module than the one from a few years before.... 

but, out of all of this the one thing that I've learned and seen... and not just in the biofuels industry.. though almost *esp* there... is .... you can NOT deploy too quickly. and you most DEFINITELY have to have the whole thing thought out before hand.

you can NOT develop technology on the fly. it'll never work. you have to have a complete or near-complete design already in place before you ever start building.. before you ever break ground.

I'm talking almost the entire process down to the nuts and bolts, the number of them, and their specific placement... in place... before you can deploy it.

The Range Fuel design was... questionable on whether or not they actually had it figured out.

As the article shows, there are scale up differences... what may work at once level may not scale right, and what may work at a larger scale simply won't work at a smaller one, and you simply can't know until you've built the larger one....

...these guys simply weren't ready to build a large plant. and they got way too much money ... which puts *way* too much pressure on everything to produce results... too many eyes watching, too much talk and not enough walk... there's no way to keep it organized.... it just turns into chaos and cost over runs and mismanagement and.... board meetings, and lunches and... trips and entertainment and... 

I suspect this is almost the point of many of these honestly... esp these early biofuel ones getting approved by the Bush admin... or under his program types... because... well... you can always say 'hey, we tried that and it didn't work... lets fund this over here'

I think there are too many people that *want* this to work... that they become clouded by their idealism and their... well... they want to see *themselves* do it and not somebody else.. they want to see that *their* work did it... they want the credit.. they want the money, they want the... job basically. They'll push and push and push to convince whomever they need to to... get them the funding.

These things need to be thought about and thought about and thought about ... ad nauseum .... people have to be so sick of it that you have to give up on it for a while because you can't do it w/out talking to someone about it, and they can't listen to you talk about it any more w/out shooting you in the face... so you shelve it... let things die down., come back to it and make a breakthrough, and shelve it again... and *most* of the breakthroughs do*n't* come in adding more... but in saving money or steps or approaches somewhere along your already existing revision.

the thing needs to be down to the level of a pre-designed lego set.

most auto manufacturers .... it costs $2.5billion to come out with a *revision* of a car style... like, from one body-type of a Ford Mustang to the next major change.. and that was like a 2005 number, I get that it's only increased.. and that was the minimum number at that....

that's why there's so much evolution for a model before it's changed... that's why the same engine (take the HEMI for example, or Honda's 4 or 6 cylinder.... or that's why Audi uses the same 4.2L V8 for the touareg as well as every other audi that has a v8... same with BMW and their 'power plants').... or the Ford F150 uses the same frame as the expedition as the xyz etc... it costs too much to redesign an individual one vs just 'swapping' one out and modular-ly putting these things in other ones..... not just in basic design and build... but the safety, the testing, the approvals, the... let alone the warranty work... and then there's the factory to build it... jesus those things are expensive.... specialty equipment has to be designed just to build equipment just to build the individual pieces that make the new design.... 3D printing will speed this up but even it will only go so far...


....this is a rant and preachy but... in my personal opinion, they bit off more than they could chew. any/most of these will.... getting the feedstock up to gasifying it to produce biocrude to refining the crude to produce the gas... evolutions are the only way to do it.

... now, that's not saying that these can't be done on paper or in one's head, and that's not to say that they can't be done quickly or tat a team can't do it very fast.... but... there's always pressure to produce... gotta pay these guys to sit down to have these talks... and then there's always the 'why am i here?' moment... combined with the 'my approach will work better than yours!' issue... that can only be proven by actually building something... which costs money... and then their focus becomes all about... well... getting the money to do this... their emotions become tightened-up/tied-up in that vs sitting back and relaxing and being able to focus on other things such that those light bulb moments can come to them ... and even when they do, the excitement of it usually still pushes for the same effect.

I see this as discovering fusion... once it can be figured out, we basically have the capability of growing all the biomass feedstock we'll ever need... 'they' don't want fusion because, with fusion we can replace all other fuel types basically... nothing else can compete on price with heavy water... it's just everywhere.... thorium either for that matter.... but, more importantly, it's like Kirk Sorensen said about fusion.... fission is like hitting a golf ball into a cone in the ground... you have all the forces of nature working *for* you... all you have to do is hit it in the general direction and gravity will take care of the rest..... fusion on the other hand is like turning the cone up side down such that it's now like a volcano... and not a curved inwards one (like a slope) but a curved outwards one... (like a bulge) and you have to make it up the sides of this thing and then, in an almost leap of faith moment... either perfectly roll it over the edge/lip to have it drop in.. or, more... flip it up over the lip/edge and have it fall down perfectly in.... like a layup in basketball.

there's just about every single force imaginable ... and then some... working against this happening... and that's just the design/physics of it... the politics, business/financial interests, human element, etc... just compound that even farther.

I'm not saying it can't be done, I wouldn't be here if I didn't... I just don't think it's likely to happen in one go like this... and with brute force.

it's going to take multiple smaller projects 'evolving' towards closer-to-perfect revisions ... slowly chiseling away at it over multiple manifestations of the design type... from multiple competitive forces or angles...  and ones that are *not* in the same group... but working towards the same ideal.... yet each secretly competing to get there.... 

ie, instead of a single $160m project, ten $16million projects... or maybe even a hundred $1.6million ones... hell, i wouldn't be surprised if it took a thousand $160,000 projects to get what they were trying to do right.

like you said... can you imagine what you can buy with that much money???

on one of these conspiracy new world order documentaries that came out in the past 5 years there was a supposed former-CIA employee that said he was what those in the know called a Jackal.... basically he was paid to go in and take over companies, infrastructures, etc of countries... with intentions of basically just taking over the country... or becoming so central to its form and function, employing *so* many of it's citizens ... both directly and indirectly (be it a Coca Cola plant or a Ford plant or a banana plantation... whatever) that they basically couldn't afford to *not* play ball... or else the whole politics of the country would collapse into disarray.

One of the methods they would use to infuse the capital into a country was dam projects... it was cheaper/easier for the IMF/World Bank to approve and fund one large central $1.5billion project inside a country... and take control of it if/when/as it failed... than to fund 10,000 $150,000 projects... it basically puts the entire country on the line... and, once it fails... they go in and... literally, either shut down the dam... and, thus everything that's tied into it from farms for irrigation, fishing, villages downstream .... built along the lake... to the electricity-requiring businesses within the country itself.... that basically they can put so much pressure on a country such as to essentially take the country over entirely... or entirely-enough such as to control it's main input and outputs... this is the same.

the problem is... you can't test some of this stuff unless it scales up... like the article says.. and that requires money. they sohuld have built a MUCH smaller plant first... and then moved up from there... 

....and, again, I still don't rule out intentional internal hemorrhaging ... but there's already enough fingers pointing blame at everything in this... enough people getting yelled at for 'wasting' $160m of the governments money .... of tax payer's money during these hard hard economic times... we'll either hear about a fall guy... or there won't be enough of one and it'll hush up... it'll be a side note in an article that covers the next wave of some similar-approaching companies in 5-10 years... ominously of course.. foreboding.. warning that it too probably won't work... fore.... if it ever does... then the hydrocarbons-into-transport-fuels 'nut' has been that much closer to being figured out such as to compete with petroleum and.... heaven forbid the US lose it's petro-backed dollar excuse... for it if works here, it can work in brazil or china or.... and, if the world doesn't need petroleum, then it won't need dollars to buy petroleum, and if it doesn't need dollars to buy petro then... the world becomes *flooded* in dollars and... the US collapses... or, inflates... or... moves outside of it's influence or control",1363639892.0
5,Vailhem,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"it should've been built for a fraction that scale ... and cost... and then, tweaked, scaled up... for a fraction the cost again, tweaked and done more....

I think the technology can and will work... I really do... i think that the less impact it makes (in scale) and the more points it has to go through to get funding, etc.. the more 'in control' and 'influential' 'they' can become and... as such.. the less threatened they will immediately be by it... as well, the less distance from each design before it they're deviating from thus... the more likely it is to work.

these systems should basically be built at just above break even levels... unless it's steel-clad proven to work (not iron clad, *steel*)... which can happen when going from the 3rd to 5th revision of an actually built design.... even more so the higher up and more proven it goes.... but, before then.... it's just as much a 'proven to work at a larger scale' deal imho.... once it's proven to work, private investors will start to jump on board.... 

I mean, can you imagine a deal is brokered where you can 'guarantee' that you're going to get xyz futures contact on wood chips.... say a 3 year contract on x-tons per day (tpd) of woodchips ... followed by another fixed 3 year contract of, say, $3.50 a gallon ethanol to, say, a local fleet shipping company... FedEx, UPS, something 'too big to fail'... where they are*n't* having to worry about adjusting prices on their fuel costs for 3 freakin' years....... obv any good buyer would build in clauses like... if gas goes *below* $3.50... say, to $3.45 you have to lower it to $3.45 .. $3.40 you lower it to $3.40... and it has to stay there for a week or something... and if it goes up... for a week... you get to raise it... in nickle increments... but we absolutely positively guarantee to buy it for $3.25 a gallon and no cheaper .... w/out paying to break the contract... which you factor in the cost price points on where that become economical to them as well..... point being, they'd have one helluva heads up on what was happening before it would happen to adjust to in bank payments, loan renegotiations, etc etc....

.... you could basically *guarantee* your investors ...be them private Joe and Jane Schmo's that banked at AgSouth Farm Credit Bank (the bank that did/processed/handled  Range Fuel's loans... ([this article](http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/12/05/the-range-fuels-failure/)... first sentence second 'real' paragraph) ... or be them freakin' UPS or FedEx themselves... 5% ROI or something like that....

...obviously it would be biomass-feedstock-dependent... but.... if it's from... say... tree companies or clear cutting a forest or something... let alone from switchgrass or miscanthus growers... then, in short... you could easily get the funding... no questions asked honestly..... it's basically all relative to the credit of the buyers ... as well the feedstocks suppliers... 

the point being.... 5% ROI... pretty much guaranteed... and put an investors insurance program to top it off... government can jump in to back that or not....  .... people are lucky to get 1% from  CD right now... stocks are risky and... well... look at how many people just got burned on Apple in the past few months... I bet *many* of them would be willing to settle for a 5% guaranteed rate of return... or a 'slight' risk... 

the gov't has no real business backing stuff of that size on those levels... be it biomass (which I'm all for) or petroleum or coal... already very proven technologies.... it's just ridiculous.

to get things started? sure... but, not to the tune of $160m.... not unless its... at *least* 'iron* clad...it's just asking for it to fail....

and, don't get me wrong, I am *all* **for** government helping new technologies getting off of the ground... helping to put together that extra 'failure protection' buffer... that private investors just might not want to do... if nothing else its a sort of national pride... otherwise, why are we all together in one big government? for the olympics? organized road infrastructures? and system compatibility? we can do that anyway, look at europe before the EU.... even with the road transition from england to france... they still figured it out w/out being one big government....

no, this is a major reason... it's also 'fun'

It's called Iceplant, grows up and down the entire coast of the Americas. The Spanish planted it here way back when because eating it could stave off scurvy in a pinch, it's also high in water content so maybe thirst too. Tastes like dirt though.

Is this really the plant? Hmm. I had no idea it was salwater tolerant. I wonder how it would respond to an actual marine environment, could you grow it actually [at sea](/r/seasteading)?

This is the plant family they mention: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halophyte

&gt; “What the scientists here have found”, he adds, “is that the halophytic family tends to be low in lignin and high in the right type of sugars, which can be converted into hydrocarbons. These plants tend to liberate these sugars relatively easily, so you need relatively low temperatures in the production process. Nobody knew this. It is a huge discovery that was made here.

&gt; ...There is yet one more element to this to complete the story, because what the researchers decided to do in this pilot project is also unique: they decided to combine the production of biofuels from halophytes with aquaculture. Morgan explains the reason behind this. “With the earth’s oceans increasingly being emptied of fish, aquaculture is growing fast all over the world. The problem with aquaculture, however, is the waste it produces. This goes right into the ocean and creates a lot of environmental problems.” This “fish waste”, he says, is essentially a fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium suspended in salt water. “And guess what halophytes need to grow? Fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium suspended in salt water.”

&gt;___Salicornia bigelovii___ is a species of flowering plant in the [amaranth family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthaceae) known by the common names __dwarf saltwort__ and __dwarf glasswort__. It is native to coastal areas of the eastern and southern United States, as well as southern [California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and coastal Mexico. It is a plant of [salt marshes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_marsh), a [halophyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halophyte) which grows in [saltwater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater). It is an annual herb producing an erect, branching stem which is jointed at many internodes. The fleshy, green to red stem can reach about 60 cm in height. The leaves are usually small plates, pairs of which are fused into a band around the stem. The [inflorescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence) is a dense, sticklike spike of flowers. Each flower is made up of a fused pocket of [sepals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepal) enclosing the [stamens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamen) and [stigmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoecium), with no petals. The fruit is an utricle containing tiny, fuzzy seeds. The southern part of the species range is represented by the Petenes mangroves of the Yucatán, where it is a subdominant plant associate in the mangroves.

13,Anenome5,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"&gt; The amount of JP-10 that can be extracted from each barrel of oil is limited, and sources of potentially comparable compounds such as trees can’t provide much help. The limited supply drives the price of JP-10 to around $25 per gallon. That price point gives researchers working on a biofuel alternative a real advantage over scientists working on replacing gasoline and diesel.

&gt; “If you are trying to make an alternative to gasoline, you are competing against $3 per gallon,” Peralta-Yahya noted. “That requires a long optimization process. Our process will be competitive with $25 per gallon in a much shorter time.”

edit: I read it... and a few more.

honestly, I'm not convinced of it. for a short-chain hydrocarbon switchgrass and miscanthus make more sense.  and, imo, switchgrass makes more than miscanthus. I just like it better, despite it not having as high of a hydrogen density, it makes biochar, provides more pulp (for paper, particle wood, etc), is hardier than miscanthus, and grows as far north as southern canada... as well, its the native grass to that these other biofuel crop-types replaced.

but, jatropha wasn't for short chain hydrocarbons... it was the oil in the seeds.  and its drought resistance (switchgrass is a major soil builder, absorbs tons of water, is is very drought resistant itself... again, it's the native grass of the midwest).

but, well, ... i'll give it that it's prob better than soy in many ways? (no clue on the energy density per acre... vs soy... and i don't like soy. period. let alone for an energy crop). .... but, i like algenol's process better. and it makes both short *and* long-chain hydrocarbons.

&gt; Where are these new biofuel crops being cultivated? Has more land been converted to farmland, or has biofuel feedstock displaced existing crops?

&gt; Their results show that the biofuel boom has coincided with significant transformation of the landscape across the entire US, with large swathes of grassland, and land not recently used for agriculture, being converted to cropland.

&gt; Second, the researchers believe that better monitoring and enforcement of the US Renewable Fuels Standard is needed, to ensure that biofuels are not planted on land cleared since 2007.

&gt; Clearing grasslands to make way for biofuels may seem counterproductive, but University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers show in a study today that crops, including the corn and soy commonly used for biofuels, expanded onto 7 million acres of new land in the U.S. over a recent four-year period, replacing millions of acres of grasslands.

&gt; The researchers also found that most new croplands were on marginal lands not well suited for agriculture and often prone to heightened risks of erosion, flooding and drought.

&gt; While cropland expanded onto new lands, 4.4 million acres of former cropland was abandoned or otherwise removed from production, most of which was enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program.

The technology is there to use this energy.  Which way it goes is likely to depend largely on political decisions.  Some may say this energy is untapped and there is an opportunity to use it rather than leaving it to ""rot"", especially when both processes release about the same amount of CO2.  Others may say that it is depleting carbon in the forests, and using natural resources that stresses the environment.  Some will say it's renewable and sustainable, others will say it isn't.  Some may say that forest residues ought to be used rather than wasted, others may say that those residues ought to never have been created in the first place.  Some may push for ""greening"" aviation fuels, while others may push for alternative transportation, and/or increased energy efficiency and energy conservation in aviation.

Is this being proposed as a premium fuel for private jets, or as a mainstream fuel for commercial airlines?  They're seemingly different markets, with different politics, different objectives, and different price points.  

There are many possible directions it could go.  It depends on how biomass will be regulated, and what the process will be for certifying and enforcing sustainability.

Meaning will the fuel-product and its manufacturing have to be proven to be carbon-neutral, or will some number of acres of forest be set-aside in conservation for each jet passenger?  ",1436633839.0

Yeah, corn ethanol (carbon intensity of 80.09) is not much better than gasoline (99.11), but biodiesel has a much lower carbon intensity (51.83 for soy, the highest out of the top fats/oils used in the US market).

The food vs. fuel debate is also silly when applied to oils. Soybeans are grown for their protein meal, which are then used as the animal feed.

(Methane is too chemically stable to react well with catalysts.  Generally all chemical fuel sources, but methane in particular, have to be converted to syngas building-blocks (H2 &amp; CO) before they can be converted to other fuels.  The currently accepted technology is an ""auto-thermal-reformer"", and requires a large capital investment in order to get high efficiency.  It's a commonly used method because historically natural gas has been so plentiful and cheap. Syngas is chemically easier to work with if you have a more immediate source of it, such as from bio-gasification.)  

Digesters seem well suited to a local small scale operation, but not to a production plant operation. For that one would need a geological sized digester, which of course is where natural gas comes from. It works great, if you have a million years to kill!
A lot of these kinds of articles I see you and others post mention research into microbial techniques. I don't know for sure how good the technology is, or whether it's production-ready or not but I'm skeptical. Certainly there are plenty of commercial sugar &amp; starch-based fermentation plants making ethanol. However, ligno-cellulose is much more difficult and complicated to process biochemically. 

I could be wrong, but my feeling is that digesters or bio-reactors are either inefficient and slow, or are more technically difficult and expensive to make fast and efficient.  While the biology to do this has existed for eons in cow &amp; termite bacteria, it seems the laboratory use of these bacteria by humans is a less mature, less well understood technology.  In the long run, it may well pan-out, but currently it seems to have more business risk compared to more established methods like gasification and FT-synthesis.  There are so many variables and unknowns as to: efficiency, scalability, stability, catalyst factors and costs, and so on. The main issue is just that it seems slow....painfully slow. It sure seems to me like it's always going to be faster to ""burn"" (gasify) residues than to ""rot"" or ""digest"" them. Gasification is much simpler and even that can get rather complex. Anyway, gasification is a more mature technology (at least for humans). That makes for a lot lower business risk when it comes time to move from the lab to a real-world operational plant. You can duplicate existing plants that are proven to work, which is a good business practice. You can buy all the parts off the shelf today, which reduces risk, cost and saves startup time.  It's fast, it's efficient. The challenges and unknown issues are not with esoteric biology, there with logistical things like material handling and storage, and transportation.  

Once you figure out how to gasify the stuff, and have the ""producer gas""/""woodgas""/""syngas"" , it's a turn-key operation from there. 
FT technology is several decades old or more. For fuel production, it's been sitting on the back-burner since 1940's Germany, simply because it was always cheaper and easier to drill for oil than to make it from scratch. Hard to say for sure, but a variety of issues may be changing that equation somewhat. If you look around and see how many wind turbines and solar cells are up, a move toward clean and sustainable energy seems to be the prevailing direction. 

With old school FT, the longer you react it, the longer the carbon chain. So you get anything from natural gas to propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, even wax if you want it. Then you need an oil refinery to separate all those. Maybe you have one on hand, maybe you don't. 

Modern FT can create methanol with very high selectivity.  Vastly cleaner and more efficient than making ""wood alcohol"" by the ancient method of wood pyrolysis / ""destructive distillation"".

Methanol used to be used more as a fuel, and like ethanol is compatible with the prevailing gasoline-blending strategy.  But ethanol fuel replaced methanol, because of corn/starch/sugar fermentation, and because of higher energy density, which is important (and really is a main reason for making energy-dense liquid fuels to begin with).

It also looks to be straightforward to convert methanol to DiMethyl-Ether (DME), a process which can probably be made fast and efficient and with good selectivity, and DME would seem to have potential as a diesel fuel or in a diesel blend. Seems like 55 is an ideal Cetane number. And a diesel blend would help with lubricity issues, and could help with compatibility with existing engines. 

As production of bio-alcohol fuel crosses the 10-15% boundary in blended gasoline, either vehicles have to be made to accept such mixtures, or other bio-fuels have to be produced besides alcohols.  Neither is a trivial proposition nor an obvious choice.  Likely some of each will occur, at least until there is a clear winner.  And don't forget there is competition with electric vehicles and hybrid-electric as well.

I expect there will continue to be a need for engines to be more or less ""flex fuel"" compatible, at least to be able to handle slightly varying fuel blends. This of course always has hiccups. 10% ethanol seems to work great in cars, but is a nightmare for small engine carburetors. 
Here in Massachusetts, only 10% ethanol blended gas is sold, by law, and I've had to clean and rebuild so many carburetors lately I've lost count.  Was it worth it?  Who can say?  ...  And so it goes...

Generally with changes in technology, it's worthwhile to have backward-compatibility.  That flexibility has to be somewhere, either in the refineries, at the fuel stations, or in the vehicles.  In a shorter 1-5 year timespan, it's arguably easier to make a small change to thousands of gas stations than to change millions of vehicles.  

If a gas station is practically limited to say 4 fuel tanks, but must serve many different types of vehicles and customer's fuel needs, maybe someday gas station pumps will automatically custom-blend fuels.  Rather than having a tank for E0 , E10, E20, etc, instead have one tank for ethanol and one tank for pure gasoline, and then let the customer select the percentage blend they want on the keypad, between 0% and 20%, for instance.

34,tinkerer13,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"In my opinion, we should abandon trying to create synthetic gasoline and diesel, and instead focus on chemically-simple fuels like alcohol(s) (ethanol and/or methanol), ""DME"" (Dimethyl Ether), or perhaps synthetic propane or butane.

Remember, one of the main reasons for wanting to find alternatives to petroleum fuels (gasoline and diesel) is their unclean exhaust pollution.   It doesn't make sense to convert clean energy into dirty energy just to maintain backward compatibility.  The goal seems to be in finding a balance between easing the transition from the past to the future, without sacrificing the future to save the past.  The fuels I mention here, like ethanol, seem like a good bridge to make that happen.  And we're already more-or-less on that path, and we have the opportunity to stay on it and develop it further, in the U.S. and around the world, if we don't get distracted in trying to synthesize gasoline.  The result could be similar to what Brazil has done with it's ethanol program, which it did by leveraging its resource(s), sugarcane, in the best way possible.  We could match that with next-generation technology if we don't get distracted by trying to synthesize old world, old school gasoline, and instead tap our unused resources in the best way possible, drawing on our agricultural byproducts like corn stalks, grass clippings, and other woody biomass, and convert these into the most efficient, cost effective and cleanest fuels possible.  

The rubber components in fuel systems that are vulnerable to alcohol fuels have already been designed out of modern vehicles.  As far as I know, the main change required to run a gasoline engine on pure alcohol is simply to burn more of it, because it contains less heat per unit volume.  This simply means leaving the engine's fuel injector open for a bit longer so that it injects about 50% more fuel (by volume).   With today's cars, this will soon be as trivial as downloading a firmware upgrade, if we aren't already at that point today.  

I believe this a good idea, because the best available technology for gasoline synthesis is only 60% efficient, so nearly half the energy is lost!.  Also it's relatively easy, inexpensive, clean and efficient to make smaller-molecule (liquid) fuels, like simple alcohols (methanol and ethanol), and ""DME"".  These molecules only contain 2 carbon atoms.  Geometrically, there are a very limited number of ways to assemble a 2-carbon molecule, so there are few ways to go wrong.  This means the synthesis processes have high ""selectivity"" and almost no unwanted byproducts.  In other words, it's efficient and clean.  

However, traditionally gasoline engines have run on a fuel closer to the 8-carbon molecule, ""octane"".  Geometrically, there are a lot of ways to construct such a large molecule, and so a lot of ways to go wrong in creating unwanted byproducts.  

When a chain of carbon gets to be 6 atoms long or more, it ""wants to"" join ends and form a ring (it is highly energetically favorable for it to do this).   This forms a class of very stable molecules known as ""aromatics"" like ""benzene"",  and ""naphthenes"" (cycloalkanes).  These can be very problematic compounds to put inside of an engine.  They can be associated with ""tars"" that gum up the moving parts.  (This turns out to be the exact same problem one runs into when trying to gasify wood, and use ""woodgas"" to fuel an engine.)  These compounds are difficult to burn quickly and completely, as is needed in an engine, because they are so chemically stable.  Often they're only *partially* oxidized.  The hydrogen on the outside of the molecule may burn off, but carbon soot can be left behind, (exactly the same depolymerization chemistry as in a smoky wood fire).  This soot has to go somewhere, so it either deposits on the engine surfaces, or goes into the oil (requiring more frequent oil changes), or it goes into the exhaust as ""particulate"" pollution.  All of these are unfavorable and problematic.  

All of that downside doesn't seem worth it, just to get a slightly more energy-dense fuel, and just to maintain full backward compatibility with the few cars now that are old enough that they can't adjust their fuel injection or still might have rubber components in the fuel line.  

I believe it's practical to live with ethanol's slightly lower energy content, because we can deal with this either by: 1) using slightly larger fuel tanks, or 2) by adding other energy-efficient improvements to vehicles, or 3) by tolerating slightly less range, and refueling slightly more often, ...or by some combination of these. 

Another option is to go with fuels like propane and butane with 3 and 4 carbon atoms respectively.  These gases are easily liquefied under relatively low pressure, so the energy density is good.  These fuels can still be synthesized rather efficiently and cleanly, with few byproducts.  This approach is perhaps not quite as clean and cost-effective as going with alcohols and DME, but is much better than trying to synthesize gasoline or diesel.  

As you know, synthesizing fuel is the reverse process of burning fuel.  So, **fuels that burn cleanly are also fuels that can be synthesized cleanly.**  So, **the advantage of using clean fuels is two-fold:  they not only *burn* cleanly, they can be *manufactured* cleanly.**  And the clean solution is not only good environmentally, it's good technology, it's good business, and all are good for the future.

You seem to contradict yourself..  ..for a bit of clarification: '[gasification](/r/gasification)' can happen a few ways... the main two+1 is gasification via [anaerobic digestion](/r/anaerobicdigestion) and gasification via [pyrolysis](/r/pyrolysis) ... the '+1' being plasma arc gasification (which is like uber pyrolysis) 

If you want longer H-C chains, or even H-C chains period, digestion.    You suggest (straight say) that a.d. is smaller scale... ...but the fermentation you speak of for ethanol is also digestion.. ...just, with the intention of producing ethane/ethanol vs methane.

You also acknowledge that ethanol in the US is plenty widespread (paraphrasing, of course) ... but, well, every gallon of gas has ethanol in it.. and, as such, i'd argue that it's a bit more than a 'niche technology'.

You say we'd need a geological scale digester ... ...not true, clearly.. ..as, well, again, ethanol percentages of gasoline.

There are 'mountain-sized' landfills spread all over the country/world using a.d. to accelerate the breakdown of the waste and capturing the gases produced to power 'various things'.   ....UPSs fleet in Atlanta, for example, utilizes landfill methane to power their trucks.

Much of SDF's airport is powered by it. There were articles years ago when it was being put in place 'advertising' it.   That UPS has such a footprint in Louisville / Louisville's airport, combined with their trucking fleet, and close proximity to this facility, I'm really surprised that UPS went with Atlanta for that project and *not* Louisville... but..

Um, the wastewater processing facility in Columbus, Oh is ... well, the landfill outside C.bus in Grove City](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.8347426,-83.0937918,2394m/data=!3m1!1e3) utilizes a.d. / methane capture..  go a bit farther up I-71 closer to Cbus and you get [this facility](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.8924808,-83.0145401,2874m/data=!3m1!1e3) that utilizes A.D. on a major industrial scale.

And, that's just ... 'around here'.   A.D. is a very established and, relatively speaking, pretty dang large industry.  Not large enough, granted, but, still... not small by any means.  

Point is, it isn't relegated to some 'afterthought' or 'experimental tech' or 'backyard farm' type of utilization.

Backing out of that.. ..I'm a fan of [syngas](/r/syngas), pyrolysis, gasification in general, etc.. ..but, i don't see one form of gasification as being mutually exclusive or 'better' than another, it's just relative to the intentions, the demand, the product, and the customer.

[Switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), miscanthus, corn stover, and other '[waste](/r/waste)' [biomass](/r/biomass) can serve a *dual* purpose in this regard..   ....first going through an a.d. step to extract and produce longer-chain hydrocarbons.. ...then utilizing the remaining pulp for paper production, a building material, compost, or sending it farther along into a pyrolysis unit to squeeze out any remaining hydrogens the a.d. didn't extract... ....and produce [biochar](/r/biochar) as a byproduct.... for all of *its* various uses. ...syngas-included.


Personally? the way i see it as best utilized?  ... swap corn with switchgrass.. ...a.d. the switchgrass, use the pulp for paper production and stop cutting down trees.   but, where markets exist, pyrolyze the post-a.d. remains and utilize the syngas for a n.gas swap.. ...or, mix with n.gas much like ethanol is mixed with gasoline.. ...'cut' the amount of n.gas needed for energy production, and utilize it for.. ...well, to go with your gas station idea.. ...most gas stations have n.gas lines running to them.. ...use these to fill up n.gas storage tanks (above or below ground) and pump up the n.gas vehicles..   ..so, if someone doesn't want to fill up at home in their Honda PHIL station.. ..or is out n about on the road.. ..they have gas station convenience.

Or, better, use the H2 from the syngas produced for the various H2 markets... ...fuel cell vehicles perhaps.

Either way, it ends up becoming a carbon negative fuel.

The idea of gas stations making their blends would be nice, but is a bit ideal and unlikely to happen.

i stick with what i said in my last reply......the two aren't mutually exclusive.  to get the longer-chain h-c's, a.d., then to get syngas, either use select feedstock to *just* pyrolyze, or pyrolyze the post-a.d. pulp.   but, syngas is expensive to clean up. even more expensive to F-T up to longer chain hydrocarbons.
In this market? with oil prices being &lt;$30? it simply isn't cost competitive.

37,tinkerer13,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"Sorry, when I said ""gasification"" I meant with a pyrolysis type gasifier.

Biogas produced in anaerobic digesters consists of methane (50%–80%), carbon dioxide (20%–50%), and trace levels of other gases.  

&gt; extract and produce longer-chain hydrocarbons

Not sure how you'd expect to do that.  Seems messy if not practically impossible.  

Fermenting cornstarch with yeast to make ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is trivial.  With ""woody biomass"" (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), you either use the a.d. to get methane, or a pyro gasifier to get H2 and CO (""producer gas"" or syngas).  

Methane is only 1000 BTU/ cu.ft.  At 300 psi, you'd need a 5 or 6 cubic foot tank to hold the equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline.  Higher pressures of CNG get very costly very fast (refill station costs multiple times more than a typical gas station).  For that reason refill stations are not too common.  No, you can't use any gas line unless you have a special compressor that goes up to 3000+ psi.  I guess it works, but I wouldn't call it practical or cost effective.  Besides you have to buy the ""CNG"" car or modify an old engine's fuel system to handle it.  PITA.  Doesn't really use existing infrastructure as much as one might think, or like.  

Best use for a.d. I saw is in an urban slums in undeveloped countries that have sewage disposal problems.  It essentially processes sewage (collect, compost and sanitize humanure), then pipeline the gas back out to use for cooking, etc.  win-win-win
",1453701020.0
38,tinkerer13,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"I don't think I am.  *Which* infrastructure are you talking about?  

I know there are millions of landfills producing unused (a.d.) ""landfill gas"" (basically the same composition of gases).  However, just because this exists and it may be ""free"" for development, doesn't mean it's zero incremental-cost to tap it and utilize it.  It's potentially a great start, but there can be a lot more infrastructure to add with connecting pipes, filtering, compressing, removing the CO2, distribution, and so on.  

The issue has been studied.  Apparently, gas utilities have been reluctant to lower the quality of the pipeline gas, both in terms of purity and heat value.  I agree with you that if those things were non-issues, then it would be technically possible.  

Apparently it can be difficult to remove *all* the CO2, to make it ""pipeline grade"".  Probably can't see it now, but I remember there was an innovation request on it awhile back, on this site:  http://ninesights.ninesigma.com/

My idea was to remove half the CO2 (which is the easy half).  This makes it close to the H/C ratios needed for Methanol.  Then FT synth to HC fuel.  

By the way, syngas to Methanol is not a difficult process.  It looks quite easy.  It works with low pressure, low temperature over a cheap catalyst.  Some FT processes benefit from high pressure, but as I understand it the only real reason high pressure is often used industrially is to increase throughput.  

I don't see how the corn-ethanol production infrastructure is compatible with anerobic digestion of cellulose &amp; lignin.  Since the former deals with sugar &amp; starch that yeast can feed on, and the latter does not.   Aside from very special cases (sterile cultures of carefully selected microbes in a lab setting), in general anerobic-digestion of cellulose &amp; lignin *doesn't* produce sugars or starches.  It produces methane and CO2 and organic fertilizer / sludge.  

Even in those special cases, realistically I don't see how natural methods are going to improve on the digestive system of a cow, which is highly optimized, and even then only extracts 2/3 of the energy from grass.  A horse extracts about 1/2.  A pyrolysis gasifier extracts 95%+ , and does it orders of magnitude faster, with simpler technology.  I'm not trying to slam the door on those R&amp;D efforts and prospects, but nevertheless, there's a clear favorite in my opinion, at least for the nations in temperate-climate latitudes.  

If you're in tropical Brazil and can grow C4 sugarcane, it's a different story.  Sugarcane is astonishingly efficient.  Maybe someone should develop a variety of sugarcane that grows in temperate climates.  Just a matter of time before they put sugarcane genes into a corn plant...or who knows, maybe desert cactus.

Anyway, I digress.  The hard part seems to be making biofuels compatible with the petroleum infrastructure.  Alcohol is nearly maxed-out at about 10% of gasoline, unless changes are made all the way down the line.  You can't really feed-into a pipeline unless you're making essentially the same (petroleum) fuel that's already in the pipeline.  If you start changing the pipeline's fuel composition, this has a ripple-effect that effects all the end-users downstream.  

Commoditizing a product seems synonymous with making a product that is consistent, reliable, predictable, and essentially constant in all regards.  If one starts changing that, quality goes down, it changes the whole value-proposition, and the business model.  I hate to say it, but I mentioned the undeveloped slum partly because lower quality utility services still have competitive market value.  And partly because those people are in need.  Partly because there is an opportunity to tailor the infrastructure, which makes it easier to deal with compatibility issues.  Sometimes it's easier to start from scratch, than to try to make changes while it's still in-use, and maintain backward-compatibility.",1453752800.0

Maybe this guy shouldn't worry so much about double-counting, and focus on doing a correct single-count.

Sustainable forestry doesn't destroy the land or the forest, when done properly (which is not that difficult), it co-exists in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.  It is good stewardship by definition.  

Most of the resource potential is never harvested.  It's left to rot and so it's never really counted to begin with.   It's also not comparable to other forestry products that require much higher quality wood.  We're talking about ""waste"" wood and forestry ""residues"".  Fuel wood can be of such low quality that it has essentially no other use or value.  

Just harvesting a fraction of the deadwood lying on the ground contains an amount of energy comparable to US oil use.  There are very few sources of renewable energy that can make that claim, especially ones that are so easily within reach, and don't require untested technology, and would require comparatively modest additional infrastructure.  By comparison, installing solar electric or wind has a much higher impact on the land than hauling away some deadwood.

Anyone who knows the first thing about forestry knows that trees naturally crowd each other and stress each other, because they're highly competitive and drop more seed than there is room to grow.   Removing some of this surplus seed, or artificially ""thinning"" a managed forest generally reduces stress, reduces disease, increases value and quality all around.  

&gt;you can’t count plant growth as an offset if it was occurring anyway

Well you can't discount it either.  That's what renewable and sustainable means.  It means an ongoing process that has a cycle associated with it.  A cycle with some time-period, perhaps 10 to 100 years in forestry.

""Savanna"" is marginal land according to Google:
&gt;""A savanna is a rolling grassland scattered with shrubs and isolated trees, which can be found between a tropical rainforest and desert biome. Not enough rain falls on a savanna to support forests. Savannas are also known as tropical grasslands.""

The fuel injector has to stay open a little bit longer to inject a larger volume in order to get the same heat.  Not sure the best way to do this.  One idea is to insert an electrical device in the signal path to the fuel injector that would lengthen the signal's pulse width by a suitable multiplier constant.  As an EE, I know there are many possible ways this could be done, but I haven't found a truly dirt simple/elegant design yet.  

Another approach might be to use the technique of alcohol-water injection directly into the intake manifold.  You need a 1 gallon tank, and 100 psi pump, and a nozzle.  This is done with turbocharged engines to reduce knock, but it can increase engine power and efficiency even without higher compression.

84,Vailhem,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"Sounds like we're not only on the same page but the same paragraph, and maybe even the same sentence &amp; word.

That said...

&gt; An irrigated miscanthus field could theoretically hit 40 tons of crop an acre a year in the right situation.

Gotta admit, I don't really see the benefit of miscanthus.. ...over switchgrass. 

On the one hand, sure, I get that it's (a bit) faster growing, higher energy density etc.. ...but, from what I've read in researching it over the past few years.. ..and talked with people growing it.. ..it's a bit of a 'finicky' crop.  ... 'Finicky' may not be the best word.. ..it's not as 'no-maintenance required' that switchgrass can be.

It's by no means as high demand as corn or other.. ..but, it's planting is more difficult (vs broadcast seeding of switchgrass), it requires a bit more fertilizer (where switchgrass can be ignored and still bring in a crop.. ...no fertilizer needed) ...even to survive, it pulls more nutrients out of the ground..

...and that's on the 'input' side.  On the output side, sure, on the one hand you get a more energy dense crop.. ..but even if it were double the EROEI of switchgrass (it isn't.. ..at least from what I've come across thus far), *all* pale in comparison to, say, [algae](/r/algae).  Algenol's getting ~9800gpa/py  (gallons per acre per year) and, though they may have the best overall look &amp; design.. ..and organization in plant/'factory'/operation structure (always think of 'iphones' here).. ..there are other companies that are &gt;11,000gpa/py ... albeit, with less of a streamlined approach (so, an android with higher specs but lacking the 'unity' or 'streamlined appeal' of an iphone)..    ...but, I ran across something about a year ago that algenol was working on new strains all the time so.. ..integrating these new strains into their overall design is a constant evolution.

My point with that being: if *density* of energy output per acre is the focus, 'all' (other energy crops) pale in comparison to algae.   ...thus, the balance/focus has to come on something else.

The argument can (very logically &amp; clearly) be made that the initial investment of an algae plant vs a miscanthus field are totally off.. ...absolutely. and this is probably one of the largest roadblocks.. ...but, then, switchgrass is even *cheaper*.  Broadcast seeding vs miscanthus being required to be grow (usually in a greenhouse environment) then moved and planted in soils that cater to machine planting.. ...switchgrass's broadcast seeding literally allows it to be grown on 'shitty' land .. with little to no '*real*' prep being needed... no rocks removed, no tilling, no 'etc'.      so, on that end, switchgrass is even cheaper/easier than miscanthus.  I s'pose a 'tiering' can be put into effect.. ...exhausted food lands but already machine-ready for miscanthus, sub-par lands for switchgrass.. ...and 'city rooftops' for algae.. ...down to abandoned shopping malls and crap fields in the middle of rocky mountain territory .. ..or on barges in the middle of the ocean where the other two wouldn't grow w/out hauling in a bunch of 'dirt' and loading it onto the barge (???)

um.. deviated a bit obviously :)

but, yeah.. ...miscanthus doesn't have the density/'woodiness' of switchgrass.  so, basically like trying to get biochar out of corn stover.  It's just.. ...not worth it.

So, I suppose I'm arguing that, 'as great as miscanthus is'.. ...and though it *may* increase soil health some, it's more likely to degrade it when put in actual practice..  ...I imagine these miscanthus operations going on right now will still have to spend a great deal upgrading soil health as years go by.. ..not saying actively cultivated switchgrass fields aren't going to require some inputs *too*.. ..harvesting 'anything' from the soil will, by default, require a return to the soil in one form or another in order to continue to remove nutrients from it.. ..even *with* switchgrass's deep roots being able to pull nutrients from much deeper into shallower depths, this can only be done for so long before even the depth their roots can go, and the minimalism of nutrients switchgrass requires are still leading to depletions in key nutrients vital for switchgrass's continued ... vitality? 



so, back to your sentence... ""An irrigated miscanthus field could theoretically hit 40 tons of crop an acre a year in the right situation.""

absolutely, and.. as 'against' it as it may sound like I am, I'm not. I absolutely think that miscanthus research should be continued.. ..and even commercial operations put in place / funded / granted, etc.. ...they're just not something that *I'd* invest in.. ..or, well, beyond just a general level of support for them. I simply see 'other paths' as more fruitful. From a 'mass per acre per year' perspective, algae destroys both. Even in highly 'nurtured' environments like greenhouses, special lighting, temperature control, optimal soil conditions.. ..miscanthus could only *dream* of attaining 1/4 per year the energy density/output of algae.  ...and, doing so in such a way that biochar isn't made, or isn't made of very high quality and in paltry volume.. ..I just don't see it.

I'm coming across-as and actually *being* harsher on miscanthus than I really feel.. and *def* 'hope' that doesn't spread to being a dick towards you. It's more of just an internal debate in my head typed out and shared.

But.. per the sentence before it..

&gt; Turn around , harvest, turn to electricity and biochar and put back into the soil to fertilize it.

this is *exactly* the best way to do it I think. The anaerobic digestion of switchgrass for ethanol is 'silly'. It's just.. ..even with the more aggressive digestor strains, the switchgrass is just too 'tough' and the sugars to inaccessible to really be cost effective. It doesn't compete.. ..vs miscanthus and *esp* vs .. well, 'corn' for example.  Sure doing this step first gives a higher value liquid fuel aspect.. ..as well, gives a flexibility of what to do with the pulp (paper production, building material, ...composting.. ...biochar, 'other?', etc).. ..if that is in such high demand? absolutely!  gonna imagine that hemp makes for larger paper production than switchgrass, but not sure a *ton* of research has been put towards that end.. ...yet.  *From* the perspective of paper production.. ..from renewable sources.. switchgrass, hemp, etc make a helluva lot of sense in my opinion. A redditor a year or two ago convinced me on fast growth poplar probably being even *better* for this.. ..esp for a building material crop..

but, quicker to the point I suppose.. ..I absolutely agree. I think that, for the most part.. ..unless paper company has signed a contract and is making it a point to do this (insert Office Space pr stunt here :) .. or something along those lines.. ...simply growing it and pyrolyzing it.. ..to find the 'right balance' per syngas output and biochar production.  There's a 'sweetspot' in there per market demand... ... that may lean more one way one time and more another way another time..  but, it's a pretty flexible margin either way.

but, just going straight-electricity or H2 feedstock (if syngas is farther processed) makes the most sense.  It's just way cheaper/easier to build a powerline and transport energy via it vs trying to keep the H's in syngas piped in or cooling it so it doesn't escape, or compressing it and shipping it in (train, truck, 'whatever') if pipelines are contested.. ...just strait burn/fuel-cell it on site.  or process the gases on site for 'whatever' market demand is.

Electricity is just easier to deal with, imo.  Think it would be *awesome* if Tesla went 'algae' on their roof (granted, they're about to start shipping solar panels so..) or, at least 'switchgrass' in the fields surrounding the factory.. ..kinda like a 'high tech' mixed/surrounded with a habitat providing (so, a sort of 'return to nature' angle) agricultural component (so, still thinking about the 'farmer in the field'.. ..per ethanol-corn being replaced with electric cars).. ...and, with that, brought it all onto a close-site facility, processed it, powered the plant (where the solar panels didn't meet demand).. ..and, in the process: biochar.   say, not jst power the plant but 'charge the batteries' shipped out for the first time so.. ..they could advertise: not just carbon neutral electric cars.. ...but carbon negative.  or something like that.  obviously their marketing department is *way* more talented than I.

but, this dichotomy of the future being a return to the past.. ..I think the 'few million' setting something like this off would pay back many many times over.. ...and, that switchgrass operations could/would be set up 'all over' providing electricity to the grid that, in turn, meets the output of their supercharger stations?  Like, what a helluvan ad campaign they could run!  Not only carbon neutral, but, per their operations and their charger stations, carbon negative.

Saab had a (extremely tiny) campaign that did this about 12 years ago. The air that came out was *cleaner* than the air that went in.  The killed the campaign after a very small run (can't even find links to it in the quick search I just did) but.. ...this would/could be that on crack! Tesla, not just carbon neutral but carbon negative. Reconnecting the future with the past. or some such shit.. ..and have a car being plugged into a naturescape.. ..charger station in the foreground, tesla factory with solar in the mid-ground, switchgrass field with animals in it, then a stream and mountains behind it.. and, sky, of course.   something along those lines.

Obviously I've taken this too far.",1484192606.0

Endophytic fungi, isolated from a number of different species of tropical plants, were investigated for lipid biodiesel precursor production. The extracts produced from liquid cultures of these fungi were subjected to acidcatalyzed transesterification reactions with methanol producing methyl esters and then analyzed through chromatographic (GC-FID) and spectrometric techniques (MS, NMR ¹H). The European Standard Method, EN 14103, was used for the quantification of methyl esters extracted from the fungi of the species and genera studied. Xylariaceous fungi exhibited the highest concentrations of methyl esters (91%), and hence may be a promising source for biofuel.",1506654996.0

**Abstract**

The fungal kingdom is the source of almost all industrial enzymes in use for lignocellulose bioprocessing. 

We developed a systems-level approach that integrates transcriptomic sequencing, proteomics, phenotype, and biochemical studies of relatively unexplored basal fungi. 

Anaerobic gut fungi isolated from herbivores produce a large array of biomass-degrading enzymes that synergistically degrade crude, untreated plant biomass and are competitive with optimized commercial preparations from Aspergillus and Trichoderma. 

Compared to these model platforms, gut fungal enzymes are unbiased in substrate preference due to a wealth of xylan-degrading enzymes. 

These enzymes are universally catabolite-repressed and are further regulated by a rich landscape of noncoding regulatory RNAs. 

Additionally, we identified several promising sequence-divergent enzyme candidates for lignocellulosic bioprocessing.",1506655152.0
98,Vailhem,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"Abstract

Anaerobic gut fungi are attractive lignocellulose-degrading microbes, yet the enzymatic mechanisms responsible for fungal hydrolysis remain unknown. 

To discover novel biomass-degrading enzymes and characterize their coordinated expression in fungi, we have implemented methods to sustain an anaerobic fungus in batch culture and analyze its transcriptome via RNAseq under several growth conditions. 

A new species of gut fungus from the Piromyces genus was isolated from the digestive tract of a horse, and its proliferation was monitored via fermentation gas production. 

Fungi exhibited high enzymatic reactivity against cellulosic and lignocellulosic substrates (filter paper, reed canary grass), which was repressed in the presence of simple sugars. 

Through strand-specific RNAseq and use of the TRINITY assembly platform, we were able to assemble novel cellulase genes de novo from &gt;27,000 transcripts without the need for genomic sequence information. 

We will discuss the coordinated regulation patterns observed for important enzyme families under catabolic regulatory conditions.",1506655266.0

**Abstract**

Catalytic CO2 conversion to energy carriers and intermediates is of utmost importance to energy and environmental goals. 

However, the lack of fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism renders designing a selective catalyst inefficient. 

Here we show the correlation between the kinetics of product formation and those of surface species conversion during CO2 reduction over Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. 

The operando transmission FTIR/SSITKA (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy/steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) experiments demonstrates that the rate-determining step for CO formation is the conversion of adsorbed formate, whereas that for CH4 formation is the hydrogenation of adsorbed carbonyl. 

The balance of the hydrogenation kinetics between adsorbed formates and carbonyls governs the selectivities to CH4 and CO. 

We apply this knowledge to the catalyst design and achieve high selectivities to desired products.",1506655539.0

**Abstract**

This investigation has established a complete environmentally friendly strategy for the valorization of olive mill wastewater (OMW). 

This valorization process includes different steps, namely, OMW impregnation on sawdust, drying, biofertilizer production, and soil amendment. 

The OMW impregnation on raw cypress sawdust (RCS) was performed using batch procedure mode. During this impregnation, 59% and 71% of the chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved salts of OMW were adsorbed on RCS. 

The drying of the impregnated sawdust (IS) and OMW was realized in a convective dryer at temperature ranging between 40 and 60 °C and air velocity ranging between 0.7 and 1.3 m/s. 

Comparison between both samples demonstrated clearly that the impregnation procedure accelerated the drying process and consequently allowed an ecologic recovery of water from OMW that could be reused. 

The IS sample was pyrolyzed at 500 °C for green fuel (bio-oil, gas) and char production. This residual char (IS-Char) exhibited higher mass fraction of 34.5%. 

The IS char characterization showed the presence of important nutrients (potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus) contents. 

The application of the IS char as a biofertilizer for rye-grass growth studies under controlled conditions showed promising results in terms of leaf dimensions and mass yields of the plant. 

These preliminary results indicated the validity of the established strategy to convert OMW from a pollutant to green fuels, agricultural water source, and biofertilizer.",1506656022.0

**Abstract**

Cellulosomes are large, multiprotein complexes that tether plant biomass-degrading enzymes together for improved hydrolysis1. 

These complexes were first described in anaerobic bacteria, where species-specific dockerin domains mediate the assembly of enzymes onto cohesin motifs interspersed within protein scaffolds1. 

The versatile protein assembly mechanism conferred by the bacterial cohesin–dockerin interaction is now a standard design principle for synthetic biology2,3. 

For decades, analogous structures have been reported in anaerobic fungi, which are known to assemble by sequence-divergent non-catalytic dockerin domains (NCDDs)4. 

However, the components, modular assembly mechanism and functional role of fungal cellulosomes remain unknown5,6. 

Here, we describe a comprehensive set of proteins critical to fungal cellulosome assembly, including conserved scaffolding proteins unique to the Neocallimastigomycota. 

High-quality genomes of the anaerobic fungi Anaeromyces robustus, Neocallimastix californiae and Piromyces finnis were assembled with long-read, single-molecule technology. Genomic analysis coupled with proteomic validation revealed an average of 312 NCDD-containing proteins per fungal strain, which were overwhelmingly carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), with 95 large fungal scaffoldins identified across four genera that bind to NCDDs. 

Fungal dockerin and scaffoldin domains have no similarity to their bacterial counterparts, yet several catalytic domains originated via horizontal gene transfer with gut bacteria. 

However, the biocatalytic activity of anaerobic fungal cellulosomes is expanded by the inclusion of GH3, GH6 and GH45 enzymes. 

These findings suggest that the fungal cellulosome is an evolutionarily chimaeric structure—an independently evolved fungal complex that co-opted useful activities from bacterial neighbours within the gut microbiome.",1506709974.0

In our work, thermal behavior and kinetic characteristics of spent lark mushroom substrate were evaluated to elaborate the thermal decomposition mechanisms and explore the influence of heating rate by using thermogravimetric analyzer and Coats–Redfern method. 

The study of pyrolysis temperature of raw material was also operated at the range of 410–530 °C, under the feeding rate 0.36 g/min, and the nitrogen flow 16 L/h. 

The results showed that the maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 470 °C with the yield of 14.4 wt.%. 

The analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and gas chromatography coupled with mass selective detector indicated that the target liquid production was consisted of phenols, hydrocarbons and other components. 

Simultaneously, the low oxygen and high hydrogen content in bio-oil was also determined by elemental analysis.

http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8931.abstract

***

**Significance**

The ever-increasing demand for transportation fuels, the decrease in global petroleum reserves, and the negative impact of greenhouse gases resulting from burning petroleum make renewable and sustainable biofuels an imperative for the future. 

First-generation biofuels produced from food crops are limited by cost and competition with food supply. 

Considerable effort has been made to produce fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, but the need for chemical and enzymatic pretreatment to solubilize the biomass prior to microbial bioconversion is a major economic barrier to the development of an industrial process. 

Here we report the metabolic engineering of a bacterium, *Caldicellulosiruptor bescii*, that is capable of using unprocessed switchgrass, an abundant, environmentally desirable, and economically sustainable lignocellulosic plant biomass, as feedstock to produce ethanol.


***

**Abstract**

Ethanol is the most widely used renewable transportation biofuel in the United States, with the production of 13.3 billion gallons in 2012 [John UM (2013) Contribution of the Ethanol Industry to the Economy of the United States]. 

Despite considerable effort to produce fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, chemical pre-treatment and the addition of saccharolytic enzymes before microbial bioconversion remain economic barriers to industrial deployment [Lynd LR, et al. (2008) Nat Biotechnol 26(2):169–172]. 

We began with the thermophilic, anaerobic, cellulolytic bacterium *Caldicellulosiruptor bescii*, which efficiently uses unpretreated biomass, and engineered it to produce ethanol. 

Here we report the direct conversion of switchgrass, a nonfood, renewable feedstock, to ethanol without conventional pretreatment of the biomass. 

This process was accomplished by deletion of lactate dehydrogenase and heterologous expression of a Clostridium thermocellum bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. 

Whereas wild-type *C. bescii* lacks the ability to make ethanol, 70% of the fermentation products in the engineered strain were ethanol [12.8 mM ethanol directly from 2% (wt/vol) switchgrass, a real-world substrate] with decreased production of acetate by 38% compared with wild-type. 

Direct conversion of biomass to ethanol represents a new paradigm for consolidated bioprocessing, offering the potential for carbon neutral, cost-effective, sustainable fuel production.",1509968828.0

First, I'm a huge cheerleader for biodiesel. I've use B99 in my 2006 Ford F250 6.0 for the last 3 years and absolutely love it -- I recommend biodiesel every chance I get.

There are a few factual problems with the article:

&gt;Lack of sulfur in pure biodiesel helps extend the engine life and the life of catalytic converters.

Sulfur was added to petrol diesel in order to improve lubricity. The lack of sulfur would actually reduce engine life, however since biodiesel adds its own lubricity no sulfur is needed.

&gt;When vehicles run on biodiesel, they achieve more fuel economy than diesel engines that use petroleum which means it consumes less gas and runs more miles per gallon.

While biodiesel does have a higher cetane than petrol diesel, the energy density is much less -- resulting in less MPG. Diesel has a typical energy density of 40.3 MJ/L and biodiesel has an energy density of 33.3 to 35.7 MJ/L -- that decrease in energy density will directly relate to lower MPG. You also need to be careful using ""gas"" as the generic term when you actually mean ""fuel."" It's being picky, but is important.

&gt;Biodiesel cleans dirt from the engine, but it causes a problem in that the dust can get collected in the fuel filter and cause clogging.

Biodiesel is a solvent, so it will break up sediment in the fuel tank. That sediment will be collected by the fuel filters and cause clogging. Fortunately this usually only happens with the first tank of biodiesel and after the fuel filter is replaced you can go back to the regular maintenance schedule.",1558318227.0
126,brian_g_hanson,Biofuel,t5_2w7qp,"Another thing to counter some of the cons, recent research has shown that although some biofuels cause indirect land use change, biodiesel has  shown to reduce land use and increase food. Soy protein is high in demand and provides a significant amount of oil for food and fuel. Current methods for quantifying ILUC are flawed and give inaccurate values. ""Biofuel impact on food prices index and land use change"" byD.S. Shrestha

Another is cloud point/pour point. Most WVO biodiesels freeze at warmer temperatures, however, utilizing different alcohols and oils during the transesterification process can significantly effect the fuel's freezing point. I was recently successful in making a biodiesel hit -56C without clouding or freezing. It's important we continue to research the properties of biodiesel to better our understanding.",1558450430.0

* The clean water supply must be distilled, because a PEM fuel cell generally requires 99.98%, minimum 99.8% pure hydrogen to limit degradation
* The photovoltaic cells will be running the electrolysis, but you will be expending additional power in order to pump the hydrogen into tanks for storage (assuming you are running your fuel cell at an optimum load it will have to run intermittently, i.e. after the tank is filled it can run efficiently for a period until the tank is emptied again)
* What kind of tanks will you use for hydrogen storage? I'd recommend designing the system around propane tanks, they're easy to find, cheap and low pressure. High pressure tanks will be tough to fill from a solar electrolysis basis.
* In addition, my first estimate is that your solar panels can't create enough hydrogen for consistent PEM fuel cell use. Therefore, you'll have to consider the issues of turning it on/off which has heating and cooling dynamics.

If you don't want to read it, the basic summary is that a hydrogen fuel cell like the Mirai uses almost 3x the amount of electricity to travel the same distance as an all electric car of equivalent size.

Most people respond to this with ""the technology will improve"", but the fact is there are still 3 additional energy conversions in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that don't take place in an electric car. So electric cars will **always** have an efficiency advantage.

Frankly I just don't think the advantage of refueling in 3 minutes vs. 20 minutes is worth that huge loss in efficiency. And that is especially true because electric cars can plug in and charge at home. Which means that 95% of the time, you won't be waiting at all to recharge your electric car.

A Tesla supercharger could easily be modified to output more power, but it would damage the cells. They already use pretty sophisticated connections and power distribution methods to ensure that the batteries can charge up that quickly, as compared to your in-home charging station (also limited by a lower voltage main).

What you can do instead (our university team investigated this) is have a trybrid style powertrain, with a small hydrogen fuel cell, a battery, and capacitors. 

In this system, a hydrogen tank provides the long-term storage, optimized for minimum mass per joule. This is extremely fast to fill up at a station. The hydrgoen fuel cell is then used only to charge the batteries during the trip. The batteries can then be optimized for slow charge+discharge (A low C rate) which increases their overall efficiency and operational life. But, this also means that the tractive power output is limited, so you'd need to employ some high-energy capacitor banks to provide the instantaneous power output expected in passenger cars. In a truck, which does not need much positive jerk, you could possibly get away with just the batteries and fuel cell.",1463930025.0
44,demultiplexer,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"It should also be noted that in many ways, this is already how all fuel cell cars work; they have a (small) traction battery that delivers the power, and a fuel cell stack that delivers relatively non-peaking power to both recharge the battery and drive the wheels with whatever is left over.

Fuel cells are fairly slow to respond to varying demand in the sense that it takes a couple of seconds to saturate the electrolyte with hydrogen/oxygen, so going from 0 to 100% throttle takes 5-10s. That's what the battery/capacitors in current fuel cell cars do.

Then, the whole hydrogen system also has a very significant amount of mass and cost associated with it. You'll have to do the math to see if it's worth it to sacrifice battery capacity for a fuel cell weight-wise. Also, a fuel cell requires catalyst and cooling proportional to its output power, both of which will add up to quite a lot. At current loading of 0.3-0.35g/kW, you'd need to carry about $5000 worth of (processed) platinum in your car just to recharge the battery at 250kW. And at 250kW output power, you require a cooling system capable of cooling 200kW at 65C, which is comparable to the cooling system in a very, very high end supercar (it would be comparable to running at 400kW/550hp engine at full blast, cooling it at 95C water temperature) - standing still.

That is a lot of expensive, heavy, complicated stuff to add to your car. And all the time that you're driving, it is completely unused and unusable. You're just carrying dead weight. OK, to be fair, that's what most of a car is, but we want progress, right?

Then, probably the most damning thing is: how are you going to make that hydrogen? It's going to have to come from some kind of hydrolysis to be low-carbon (or no-carbon), which means you'll actually have to have a much higher power electrolysis setup onsite than the power rating of a similar supercharger. Because hydrolysis and compression are also very lossy processes. And whereas it's very simple to upgrade superchargers to deliver twice or four times the power (as battery tech improves, we'll be able to charge faster - this will happen over timescales much shorter than the lifespan of a fuel station), it'd be prohibitively expensive to upgrade your hydrogen fuel station accordingly.

So I'd say from the outset that without some giant leap in fuel cell tech, using hydrogen stations to recharge an onboard battery in-place with vehicle-bound fuel cell. If anything, this concept would have to use an off-board fuel cell, but then why use that at all? Just use direct charging from the grid, that's 4x as efficient and thus 4x less of a burden on the power situation.",1464245418.0
45,demultiplexer,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"It's too bad that the article doesn't go a bit more in-depth into the quantitative side of things, because that exposes especially big problems with biohydrogen. 

The formate route, also known as sugar route, converts simple sugars (glucose, fructose, as well as compound sugars such as sucrose and in some cases even polymerized sugars like lignin/cellulose) into formate (HCOOH), CO2 and H2O. Then the formate, with formate lyase, can be converted into H2 + CO2. This pathway produces roughly 1.2-1.5 moles of CO2 for every mole of H2, aka about 25-35kg of CO2 per kg of H2. This can of course be short-cycle (with the sugars coming from biosources), but this again raises the issue that you need about 100-160kg of starter biomaterial per kg of H2. At least for the simplest synthesis routes. The nice thing is, though, that you don't need to introduce hydrogen into the bacterial cells themselves, extending the productive life of these bacteria to sometimes days or weeks and keeping them away from selective pressures.

The photocatalytic route essentially mimics the same redox route that [photocatalytic water splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photocatalytic_water_splitting) uses. With much the same materials, but instead of using solid pieces of catalyst, (cyano)bacteria can provide us with a self-assembling machine to do the work for us. Unfortunately, this yields two very big secondary problems. You either need to:

 -  use very high-energy light (6-7eV, corresponding to UV-C) of which only a minute amount reaches the earth from the sun, meaning you have to synthesize it, which adds another step of inefficiency. Also, most proteins and lipids photolyze in this light, so the bacteria don't survive.
 - Or use photocatalysts that survive the cellular machinery of these bacteria. So far, our best efforts still point to [Platinum, Iridium and Ruthenium](http://phys.org/news/2016-02-scientists-efficiency-water-splitting-half-reaction.html), extremely expensive and rare metals.

Biohydrogen as of now, for these reasons, really doesn't outperform or provide any real benefits over artificial synthesis and it is not expected to anytime soon. Even with part or all of the above problems solved, a large problem with distributed biosynthesis is the requirement to separate and purify the output gases, to avoid continuous mutation and competition of the bacteria (i.e. keeping a feedstock, which has its own issues) and a bunch of other smaller issues. 

That is not to say it's useless; quite the contrary. You can only do so much with mechanical machines and bulk continuous production methods. It would be absolutely marvellous if it were possible to build self-replicating, self-assembling micromachines that enable very complex chemical pathways to be exploited. The thing is, though: even with CRISPR and a vastly accelerating knowledge of protein construction in just the last few years, we're still not even close to getting to understand how to actually design such a chemical pathway. We're currently still just copying favourable traits, just by actual physical copying instead of interbreeding.

There used to be a very promising LEVs (light electric vehicles) fuel cell that was also marketed towards (ruggedized) laptop recharging and other mobile medium-power applications, made by Hydrogen Aragon (http://hidrogenoaragon.org/en/products/) for the 2008 Expo Zaragoza and supposed to be launched in 2009-2010 with partners. This saw a little bit of press at CES 2009 and 2010 but never got launched. Then the whole deal just kind of stopped. My spanish isn't great, but I don't think they ever found industry partners to manufacture and sell this with.

The only players in consumer-facing fuel cell sales that are left now are:

 - MyFC, which at the moment, sells nothing. They make the PowerTrekk (mostly recalled) and JAQ (vaporware), both are sub-5W USB powerbanks
 - Intelligent Energy. They seem to have pulled out of the consumer market entirely, but they have had a few press releases about a (now cancelled) drone fuel cell.

You should probably also think about why you would want a fuel cell for this purpose. There are plenty of very lightweight, pretty cheap commodity powerbanks to charge your laptop with. A fuel cell won't be better. For reference, the HA 150W fuel cell looked like [this](https://tweakers.net/ext/f/zCEE2FNWPQvYPPrj1CrxCFr0/full.jpg), weighed about 7kg and would only run about an hour on those two 2L flasks of hydrogen (which weighed another 8kg). The projected sale price of these bikes would have been well in excess of 3000 euros, meaning the fuel cell would be at least 1000 euros, probably more. Technology hasn't really improved much in the meantime, so you're looking at something in the order of 10-15kg of fuel cell + hydrogen container to power your laptop for a couple of hours? Lithium ion batteries of that weight and cost would power your laptop for a month! That is not an exaggeration!

Typical activity of the electrodes is in the order of tens to about 100 mA per cm2, at 0.6-0.7V/cell. So that's about half a watt per square cm, so 3-ish watts per square inch. Peak.

As for weight, that is not easy to say outright, depends a lot on the size of the FC system and how much of the 'rest' you count. For a PEMFC, if you *just* count the electrodes and PEM, very little, a couple of grams maybe. It's almost all Nafion and water, both of which are about 1g/cm3. I know that Intelligent Energy's stackup is about a millimeter thick, so that would weigh roughly 0.6g/in^2

However, you kind of can't ignore the rest of the cell. You need electrode metallization, the compression structure, not to mention the non-stack parts like lots of water, cooling, piping, scrubbers, radiators, tanks... I believe we're well over 1kW/kg at the stack level, but e.g. current HFCEVs have about equivalent drivetrain power/energy densities as battery EVs, so that should give you some idea of total system size.

(*) You ask for the most efficient hydrogen fuel cell, but that is hard to quantify. SOFCs and AFCs can get higher energy efficiency than PEMFCs, but have way lower power and energy density. Also, they only have higher energy efficiency in steady state; PEMFCs have only 20-30sec start-up time, wherease SOFCs and AFCs take many minutes to even over an hour depending on system size - and that time is mostly spent not producing power but still consuming energy.

52,demultiplexer,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"Sorry, this is basically a dead sub. But sure, I can give some answers. Also paging /u/PowerFromBeards

Producing hydrogen for vehicles, up to a few years ago, was done pretty much exclusively with natural gas steam reformers. Yes, that does produce quite a lot of CO2 per mile - a Mirai would have the effective fuel-based CO2 output of a very efficient compact car. Or about half that of a similar class car. Since then, ITM in particular has been exclusively selling 'green' hydrogen from PEM electrolyzers running on wind power. In California, the state also mandates I think 30% of hydrogen has to come from renewable sources. Don't quote me on that exact number. Things are definitely moving in the correct direction. I should also mention that the - for now vaporware - Nikola company is planning to build wind/solar-powered electrolyzing refueling stations for their Nikola One that they purportedly will allow others to use as well.

If that last thing doesn't happen, it is unclear how hydrogen production can really scale up economically. Those ITM stations can only supply a few dozen kg H2 per day, enough to fuel a handful of cars at most. Skeptics will say the remainder will probably come from reformed natural gas. Maybe corn ethanol.

If your reference is 10 years ago, the infrastructure has been positively booming. 10 years ago there were 3 working and 3 demonstrator hydrogen dispensing stations, now there are 30ish (if you squint real hard). Europe and Japan also have a dozen or so each, at least the working ones. There is one 15km from where I live! If your reference is 2012, the year California started their build-out, it may come as a bit of a shock that only 25 out of 100 (initially: 300) stations have been built. Suffice it to say there have been some hurdles, and infrastructure is still by far the biggest issue plaguing HFCEVs. There are enough stations to support maybe 1000 active vehicles in the bay area, nowhere else. Most FC vehicles and fueling stations are just for show.

The most frustrating thing, in my opinion at least, is the sheer lack of any advances. The most major thing we've seen is the platinum loading decreasing by almost an order of magnitude since 2007. Mirai now requires only about 40-50g of platinum for 110kW, where in 2007 a Hydrogenics HyPM7 would require 20g for ~10kW. Platinum prices have remained pretty stable too, so this is a big cost advantage.

All that being said, PEM fuel cells are still way too expensive and cumbersome to work with in EVs. The Mirai, despite having 'high energy density' fuel, still is over 4000lbs, pretty much the same as a similar-range BEV. Even though it's selling at $60k, most analyses (note: Toyota does not give any hard numbers on this) conclude that they're probably losing $50-100k on each car produced. This is all very much in line with the state of the art back in the late '00s, when the FCX Clarity had the same kind of numbers.

In other FC news, SOFCs have been pretty stagnant. The biggest media hit has no doubt been the Bloom Box, a natural gas autoreforming stationary SOFC. It was supposed to be the future of data center power, but it turned out to be something like $10k/kW, so pretty fucking expensive, even compared to Diesel generators. It has found its niche though. Another big SOFC user now is Microsoft, who is building (or has built? I haven't been following this story) a data center fully backed by natgas-powered SOFCs. Apparently at a much lower cost than the Bloom Box too. Stationary SOFCs and AFCs now account for the vast majority of global fuel cell sales.

Most likely, SOFCs will remain popular in areas where natgas is cheaper than electricity and a lot of power is needed - think reverse osmosis plants, data centers near large bodies of water, etc. Reversible fuel cells are still a good candidate for seasonal energy storage, something that may become relevant really soon as renewables penetration increases.

53,PowerfromBeards,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"Broad strokes this is pretty accurate. I could paint in a few details and change things, but it's close.

At the core, the major advancement is cheap non-fossil electricity, and cheap natural gas. That's why development was stagnant. Electricity is the major cost of producing green hydrogen. There was no real point in pushing hydrogen tech when it was just repackaged fossil fuels. Biomass sources can also theoretically do make green hydrogen, but you run into traditional bio-fuel crop problems. 

Now you regularly see average wholesale prices in the US or wind contracts at cheap enough prices to justify electrolyzers for hydrogen or Power to gas (P2G) 

NEL (formerly Norsk-hydro) is building electrolyzers to produce hydrogen that can compete with methane reforming produced hydrogen. Germany has had a decade or so of test plants and are now moving into MW and further P2G demonstrations.

SOFC has been slowed/deployed by Bloom. That $10k/kW cost is certainly price gouging, or they are just lazy. The major costs of producing most FC techs has always been the low-scale of production. At producing 50MW of SOFC stacks a year they should be at $500/kW according to the DOE (I can corroborate to some degree from industry contacts in the past that it is reasonable as of a few years ago). Which basically means, the large companies that have now seen proof-of-concept Bloom systems are pretty free to go get better suppliers now.

Of course in small-vehicles which most people are interested in you are mostly limited to PEM (or advanced alkaline, which is abandonware). SOFC is difficult to adapt to a fast start, although Nissan is trying, with some(?) success. Japan has been pushing a hydrogen society steadily for some time and is making some progress. The Mirai fuel cell probably costs anywhere from $50,000-$150,000. They have sold (not sure on leases) ~3000 worldwide. I think the target was around 6000. Which likely pushes the cost closer to $150,000. At production levels of 500,000 units per year, the FC should cost $40/kW according to Toyota (or ~$4000 for the stack as opposed to ~$100,000) I expect the next generation Toyota FC vehicle will make clear if there is a future for small FC vehicles.

&gt;The most frustrating thing, in my opinion at least, is the sheer lack of any advances.

Any advances at this stage are subtle. Also, there is lot of misguidance from the funding agencies in the US about finding alternatives to platinum. The platinum is only ~5% of the cost of the FC. (Interestingly, by using non-platinum catalysts, the cost of the system often goes up due to lower performance and needing more membrane area). The membranes are a major cost, and again it is a scale up issue.  If a company makes their own nafion membrane as opposed to buying it, the cost can drop by a factor of 10-100.

Basically, if someone made a FC gigafactory, they would be cheap, and there would be a market, but it's a huge risk and not established all the pieces. Cheap electricity for electrolyzers is a major paradigm change since 10 years ago (electricity is 80% of the cost of electrolytic hydrogen production).",1509755238.0

Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit mass, though the accurate term for this is specific energy. Often only the useful or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as rest mass energy) is ignored. In cosmological and other general relativistic contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the stress–energy tensor and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

63,demultiplexer,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"I've been pretty light on the jargon in this particular post, and really only used very common acronyms like PEM and SOFC. The gist of my post is understandable without fully understanding what the acronyms mean, just that they point to a specific type of technology.

That being said, I'm always happy to expand:

PEM: Proton Exchange Membrane, a type of material that allows protons (hydrogen ions) to pass, but nothing else. This is a key technology in room-temperature fuel cells, and is currently the most popular and cheapest fuel cell technology with by far the most research behind it.

SOFC: Solid oxide fuel cell. A family of high-temperature fuel cells that can often accept a very broad range of fuels. Any hydrocarbon or hydrogen-rich material that readily oxidizes can be used to convert chemical energy to electricity in a SOFC. The most notable downside is that it requires a warm-up time much like ICEs.

AFC: Alkaline fuel cell. The oldest type of fuel cell, and arguably the most widely deployed one. Mostly has military and space uses these days. Very simple and cheap to make, but has terrible power density and slew rate.

HFCEV/FCEV: (hydrogen) fuel cell electric vehicle. Analogously: BEV: battery electric vehicle.

77,WikiTextBot,Fuelcell,t5_2uz9z,"**Molten carbonate fuel cell**

Molten-carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) are high-temperature fuel cells that operate at temperatures of 600 °C and above.

Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) are currently being developed for natural gas, biogas (produced as a result of anaerobic digestion or biomass gasification), and coal-based power plants for electrical utility, industrial, and military applications. MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of  beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE). Since they operate at extremely high temperatures of 650 °C (roughly 1,200 °F) and above, non-precious metals can be used as catalysts at the anode and cathode, reducing costs.Improved efficiency is another reason MCFCs offer significant cost reductions over phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs).

The reason they are called fuel cells is sort of an academic naming as an extension of electrochemical cells. So what else to call them?

From a structural point of view, they're more or less a half-open flow cell, where one of two reagents comes from the atmosphere and the reaction product is vented into the air. So, half-open flow cell? Not really much better.

From an operational point of view, it's like an engine in that it takes oxygen from the air, fuel from a container and spits out exhaust, but its output is electricity. Electric engine? That doesn't work. It also doesn't have moving parts, so solid state electric generator? 

Fuel cell is short, identifiable (if strangely named) and by now has significant momentum. The alternatives are probably just as confusing in various contexts. Probably best to think of it as just a name, not as anything descriptive. We're probably stuck with it.",1579631356.0
