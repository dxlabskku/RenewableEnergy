2,sniper001,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I'd be skeptical about many claims of AC units being more efficient than others. AC units really all work in the same way. There for sure will be efficiency differences, but they're likely all within 10% of all other AC units in the same power rating.

What you should think about is the efficiency of the total system, which includes the building itself. If there's anything you can do to seal up around doors and windows, that matters significantly more than which AC unit you select. Sealing the window the AC unit is connected to being the most important, as that will have the greatest temperature differential to outside. Even adding something for insulation of that window if it's a simple single-pane window. They make clear plastic sheets that stick to the window frame so that there's a ~2"" air gap between the plastic and the window, adding a very effective insulation layer.

If you can get away with it, try to only cool one or two rooms so you have somewhere to go when you're too hot, or put a partial barrier like a sheet over a doorway into another room so it only gets partially cooled and doesn't lose as much of the cold air to the outside.",1550985817

7,easyrider46,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I've just started studying electricity, having said that, I think you are wrong, current can indeed return to ground, instead of neutral. If it couldn't, then you couldn't get shocked by touching the hot wire while grounded. 

It's dangerous and maybe even illegal, but it does work.

Also, the grounding cable may very well be the neutral, the guy who wired it may have ran out of blue cable, and just used grounding cable instead. Modern homes have safety switches that cut off power if they detect current going to ground. 

So your power outlet should work, by using that grounding cable as a neutral, but you shouldn't use it for a power outlet, that circuit was only designed for a light bulb. You need two wires to carry current, and a grounding one for safety reasons.",1578592408
8,sniper001,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Current consumption is not an indication of the cost of the electricity.

Did you actually measure the KWh consumed over the course of a day? Did you control for the temperature differential inside/outside the building?

They likely are more efficient units, but the only efficiency gain is that the unit that cycles on/off is going to take a minute or two to reach steady-state, where the cold side is cold and the hot side is hot. This process may take a minute, but if the unit is running for 10 minutes before shutting off, a slightly lower efficiency for one minute is not significant.

The inverter unit appears to use less energy, but if it's replacing a unit that cycled 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, it will appear to use half the amount of energy even if in total it used exactly the same amount of energy.",1551062002
9,NoRoomForEmpire,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt;If I touch a wire with current, why would I get shocked? Electricity follows the path of least resistance. Shouldn't my body have way more resistance than the copper wire I'm touching, therefore electricity should not go into me.

The path in the wire is still the path of least resistance, but by connecting yourself you are creating a parallel path. A portion of the current will now pass through you to ground and a portion will continue down the wire to the original load. The amount of current that travels down each path depends on your own resistance and the resistance of the original load. 

&gt;I also don't get grounding. Who is ""more grounded"" -- some one standing on the ground wearing rubber shoes or someone standing on the ground barefoot? In these two scenarios, who gets shocked worse if they touch a wire  with juice?

First, we will assume we are dealing with normal residential voltages and that you are standing on a conductive, grounded surface. 

If you are wearing shoes with rubber soles, the rubber is isolating you from the ground. Therefore, you are not considered to be grounded. If you were to grab on to a hot conductor, you would not create a parallel path to ground and all the current would continue down its original path. 

In the scenario where you are shoeless, your conductive skin is in direct contact with ground. You are not isolated from the ground and will make an acceptable parallel path to the ground. 

Now, if we are in an industrial setting we could be dealing with much higher voltages. Your normal everyday street shoes may no longer be enough to sufficiently isolate you from ground. Think of voltage as pressure. A high enough electrical pressure may be enough to blast though your soles right to ground.

25,xSpAceMonKeyx,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Listen kid, I know I'm reaching this post very late (2 months late to be exact), but I really hope you read this response.

Last year around this same exact time, I was a senior in high school and had absolutely no idea where I wanted to attend school.  I knew I wanted to end up in business/sales, but I didn't know which school would be the best for me.  Long story short, I ended up at a technical school 9 1/2 hours away from home studying Automated Packaging Systems.  Don't let the ""technical school"" part fool you.  I have never been in a more intensive program in my entire life.  For the first time ever, I am learning real-life applicable skills that I will forever have under my belt.  A large portion of these skills consist of electrical work and electrical knowledge.  Let me tell you this; electricity is some incredible (excuse my French) shit!  

Why I happened to bring up the technical school aspect maybe confuse you, so let me explain.  I have a very large friend group.  This friend group consists of a large handful of intellectual and very smart people.  Everyone in this friend group attended a 4 year university, save for me.  Not ONE of them has learned anything or taken any steps to further their path in their major.   I don't want to knock on 4-year universities, but their educational system is pitiful.  Throwing 300 students in a lecture hall and having them take notes and by chance participate in some labs and then testing them all on the material and slapping a grade in the grade book has absolutely no correlation to real-life or job skills whatsoever.  On the other hand, however, I have done nothing but hands-on work at tech school and learned far more than I ever would've expected to.  I have been to multiple company-wide expo shows, met real employers from the real-industry, and been on a handful of tours of different companies.  The #1 complaint from employers was that students coming out of 4-year universities lack the ability to ""do"".  They are great when it comes to paperwork and diligence, but they lack the ability to perform on actual industry hardware/components due to their lack of experience.  

The reason why I'm telling you all of this is because you mentioned you're interested in electrical work and electricity.  I can 150% guarantee that you will receive a much more enthusiastic, hands-on, personalized learning experience with electricity at a prestigious technical college as opposed to a 4 year university for electrical work (and a large handful of other types of work). ",1453360329
26,Raistlen007,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It's easiest to think about it this way. 

The power you generate for yourself decreases your demand from the grid. If you generate more than you use, the excess gets pushed out to the grid.

For the meter it's not a problem. Modern electronic meters can easily have a sum total measurement for the Kilowatt Hours KWH in both directions. 

For example, your IMPORT KWH can be 6,000 total and your EXPORT KWH can be 3,000, and based on the net metering agreement, in a classic arrangement you would have to pay for 3,000 KWH under the net rate.

There are no phase issues because the connection to the grid will always be at the proper voltage and hz. Your solar inverter is powered by this. What the inverter ends up doing is decreasing the load in your installation, and if your generation is greater than your demand, you're lowering the demand of your neighbors.",1454274995

34,Lesh1025,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It's kinda simple actually. You know transformers use two coils (or more in some). You have the primary and secondary. What you're talking about its called a ""step-up transformer"".I &gt;How can a transformer take voltage and increase it?&lt;  by taking voltage into the primary, therefore creating a magnetic field that crosses to the secondary coil, by induction. Now that the first coil created its own magnetic field, this magnetic field will be limited by the amount of turns and resistance in the wiring. The second coil is made with more turns, therefore less resistance and a stronger magnetic field, creating a higher voltage.  

A fact to know. A distribution transformer (the one on the side of your house) it's a perfect example for a step-down transformer.  Say the primary coil is taking in 12,000v and .1amp (from city lines). That means that the secondary will have and output of 117v and 10.25 amps. A 1:102.5 turns ratio. ",1461387915
35,NoRoomForEmpire,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"To begin with, a battery will not work with a transformer. Transformers will only transform alternating current, AC. Batteries are direct current, DC. AC electricity is what is coming out of your wall at home. 

The voltage of an AC signal is constantly changing polarity from + to -. It does this very quickly. Here in the US, the electricity that comes to your home/business/industry changes from + to - and then back again once every 0.0167 seconds, or 60 times every second. If you were to graph this voltage, it would take the form of a sine wave. The DC voltage from a battery does not change polarity and it's graph would be a straight line.

Now, on to transformers. It's all about inductance. Inductance is a property of electrical conductors that generates a voltage in the conductor when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field. 

Transformers are made of two separate coils of wire placed in close proximity to each other. When alternating current is introduced to one of the coils of wire, the constantly changing polarity of the voltage produces a constantly expanding and collapsing magnetic field. When the second coil of wire is exposed to this changing magnetic field it induces a voltage in the second coil. 

The stepping up/down of the voltage all depends on the number of turns of wire in each of the coils. If the coils are made with the same number of turns in each, the voltage in will be equal to the voltage out. If the first coil has more turns and the second coil has fewer, the voltage in is greater than the voltage out. Lastly, if the first coil of wire has fewer turns and the second coil has more, the voltage out will be greater than the voltage in. 

We'll take a closer look at the last example because that seems to be the configuration that troubles you.
When 120V is introduced to the primary coil of the transformer 240V will be found across the secondary coil. This means that there are twice as many turns in the secondary side as there are in the primary side. This may seem like magic, but the thing that makes this possible is that where the voltage goes up the amps go down. The amps decreases by the same factor that the voltage was increased. If we were to step down the voltage, the available amps would step up.

It's all about conservation of energy. Energy being consumed is power. In the electrical world, the rate at which energy is consumed is measured in watts. Power is watts. Watts is the product of voltage and amps. So if one increases and the other decreases, the power remains the same. So in short, the power out of a transformer will be equal to the power in to the transformer. In reality, the power out is always going to be a bit less because no system is 100% efficient. There are always losses.
",1461391966
36,NoRoomForEmpire,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The only current that will flow in the secondary coil will be the current that is demanded by the load that is attached to it. A higher resistance will draw less current and a smaller resistance will draw more. If there is no load connected to the secondary coil, there is not a complete circuit, and no current will flow. If put a very low resistance load on the secondary, a short, then the current will run away until the transformer burns up, you blow a fuse or trip a breaker. 

The thing to remember though is that power out will never be more than power in. If you short the secondary and the current increases in the coil, more and more of that voltage will be lost in the coil and will never makes it to the load. So even though the current flowing through the load is now more, the voltage across the load is less. Watts remains the same.

39,Hiddencamper,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Normally you have a slew of different electricity producers on the grid, and you have the most expensive sources come offline first as demand goes down. Nuclear *usually* isn't a marginal energy source, meaning it never gets to a point where nuclear has to lower output. This is changing in some areas.

If it comes down to a nuclear unit lowering output due to economics or grid requirements, the majority of nuclear units pay a premium to not have to lower power. They then get passed over on the list, and other units will come down, and it doesn't come back around to nuclear unless there's something severe going on with the grid.

That said, your info about nuclear plants is not accurate. I'm a senior reactor operator and my reactor participates in load following the grid. It is not *preferred* to load follow, but it is definitely doable. In fact, in some grids there are a handful of nuclear plants that participate in load following. 

The nuclear chain reaction is easily controlled. I can rapidly lower reactor power down to around 45% in as little as 15 minutes if I had to. For my boiling water reactor, the majority of our power changes are made rapidly by changing reactor cooling flow. Increasing cooling flow pushes the steam out of the core faster. This leads to more cooling, and more liquid in the core, and raises the moderation of neutrons. This causes power to go up. Lowering cooling water flow does the opposite, steam spends more time in the core, the core heats up, and power lowers. By changing core cooling flow I can rapidly raise and lower reactor power. I never have any limits lowering reactor power, but there are limits raising power based on the conditioning of the fuel and how much xenon poison builds up in the core. 

PWR plants can load follow quickly as well. Naval PWR reactors in submarines can go from 5% to 95% in minutes. Commercial PWRs can load follow quickly as well if they choose to, however because they operate with boron in their core they end up having to dilute or add boron which can take a little while, and also affects boron supply.

Nuclear power plants typically do not want to load follow lower than around 45%, as you have to start shutting down extra pumps and aligning the plant for low power mode. The plant isn't designed for extended operation in low power configurations, and can lead to vibrations and wear and tear on the plant, along with efficiency losses, which are not an issue when operating at higher power levels where the plant is designed to be.

Power production on the grid must always be matched with demand. Not perfectly matched, but pretty close. If there is a mismatch, grid frequency will start to drift. In the US, the grid operates at 60 hz, and there is an allowable operating band for frequency, typically less than 0.5% of 60hz. If frequency is starting to go up, the power grid will dispatch plants to drop production, and if frequency goes down, the grid will dispatch plants to produce more energy. 

If there is an excess of energy, nuclear plants, even ones that do not participate in load following, can be ordered to perform emergency power reductions to support the grid. Even before my plant began participating in load following plans, we always had a standing order to lower power by around 30% in under 30 minutes to prevent grid overloading. It's only been used once that I know of, but it happens sometimes.

The whole ""nuclear power stations can't be turned off"" thing isn't true. It's just that nuclear plants do not like to operate below 45% power. Also, most large turbines like those at nuclear plants start to vibrate and become unstable if they are operated below 20% for too long, and will need to be taken offline. The issue with nuclear is if a full shutdown is needed, it takes a while to start back up. Restarting a reactor after a scram takes upwards of 24 hours. And even after restarting the reactor, if the reactor plant is not fully heated up, you will add another 8-24 hours to that, depending on plant and situation. But the heatup limits are true of any large thermal plant, not just nuclear. 

As for storage, in merchant markets, storage companies simply buy electricity to operate when prices are low, then sell electricity when prices are high. In regulated markets there may be some coordination to try and keep plants running, but honestly its less efficient to do that than to lower output of units and have less thermodynamic losses.

40,TurnbullFL,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"If a nuclear plant operating at full power is suddenly disconnected from the grid, doesn't that full power have to be dissipated by the cooling towers(essentially wasted) during the time it takes to shut down and cool the reactor. ",1462211605
41,capitalmonks,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I think everyone has gone off track a bit with answering OP's question and are overlooking the electricity market operator... that is the overarching body responsible for grid operations. Power stations can only generate into the grid when they are requested to by the market operator. This is known as 'market dispatch.' The grid operator dispatches generation into the grid to match the forecast load requirements for that period in time. So in essence, there is no such thing as excess energy. 

Basically the market operator has a mix of generators to choose from to match the load requirement of the grid. Generators bid a $/MW to the market operator for the opportunity to generate. The market operator will then dispatch the generators from cheapest to dearest, until the load value has been met.

Generally large coal-fired and nuclear plant are the cheapest due to the $/MW they are able to offer and are almost always dispatched. This is a good thing because 'turning off' these stations is an issue because firing them up again takes a long time, boilers will take a few hours to heat back up again if they get cold, etc. These are known as 'base-load' generators: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load_power_plant

There are also medium cost intermittent or load-following generators (large gas fired plants).... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_following_power_plant 

... and expensive peak generators (small gas-fired, pumped hydro sometimes).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant 

Hydro generation is tricky because it is sometimes used as a intermediate and sometimes as peaking plant (it is very easy to turn a hydro station on and off as it just involves opening and closing the floodgates.) It is all dependent on the local electricity grid and the current conditions in the 

So as you can see, there will never be excess energy in the grid that needs to be absorbed. Pumped hydro stations operate as a peak plant to take advantage of the market pricing to try and make some sweet sweet profit, not to use up 'excess' energy- it is a purely economic reason. This is because pumped hydro take advantage of low dispatch prices when the grid load is low (maybe on the cheap base load generation is dispatched.) and generally pump on off-peak times. When the load is high and the market operator needs a peak generator, the pumped hydro plant (which stored water the night before), will now generate into the grid when the dispatch price is high.

Because pumped-hydro stations can pump the water when electricity prices are low, then generate into the grid with said water when the prices are high; they should come out with a net gain.

Hopefully this helps... happy to elaborate further if you would like!

42,Hiddencamper,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Short answer: yes it does. But the sudden disconnect from the grid will cause nearly all reactors to trip offline due to the severity of that transient.

If you have a sudden disconnect, this is called a load reject. No US plants are currently capable of handling a full load reject. Some plants can, like CANDU reactors in Canada. During the 2003 blackout, many of the CANDU units were able to survive the load reject on the grid, stay critical at low power, and within 10-20 minutes reconnect to the local grid to start restoring power. 

Anyways, on a load reject most plants will immediately scram. Some will try to load follow but won't make it due to the severity of the transient and will scram on high temperature or pressure. If a plant was at low power, it may stay online dumping steam to the condenser, depends on the plant and how the loss of load occurred. 

After the scram occurs, the reactor is now at decay heat power levels. There is no heat generated by splitting the atom, only the heat generated by the radioactive waste that builds up in the fuel rods. Initially this is about 7% of the reactor's rated power, and decays over the next several hours and days. This decay heat needs to be removed, and initially is removed by dumping steam directly to the condenser like you said. 

If the condenser is not available, PWR plants can dump their clean steam to the environment, and if that's not available, or if it's a BWR plant, you can dump steam or reactor coolant directly inside the containment. 

You continue dumping steam to lower pressure and temperature of the reactor coolant system, and you use either main or emergency feedwater or the emergency core cooling system to make up for the steam you are venting. 

Once the temperature and pressure are low enough, typically less than 330 degrees F, you can put the shutdown cooling heat exchangers on service to directly cool the core and you can stop steaming at this point. The reactor will finish cooking down using the heat exchangers. The heat exchangers will need to remain in service almost indefinitely.",1462225350

62,TheRealFalconFlurry,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Batteries are not usually rated in watts because wattage is a product of voltage and current. In a battery voltage is usually relatively constant while the current can vary drastically and is dependent on the resistance of the load, therefore your wattage will also change. Batteries are usually rated in Ah (ampere-hours) which dictates how long a battery will last on a given load. A battery with a capacity of 1Ah will be able to supply a load that draws 1amp for one hour before the voltage drops below the acceptable threshold. The same battery could supply a 0.5A load for two hours or a 2A load for a half hour...etc

Solar panels are often rated in watts as a maximum available output because they can generate a more steady current, but the voltage is also important, especially if you are planning on charging a battery with it. Solar panels have a rated voltage and an open circuit voltage; the open circuit voltage is the voltage measured across the terminals when there is no load (nothing is connected to it), this voltage is often around 1.5 to 2 times higher than the rated voltage. A 12v solar panel will probably have an open circuit voltage of 16-24v, but it is rated to supply a 12v load. The power of your solar panel is a product of its available voltage and current and is only used to determine current which, in turn, determines how fast your battery will charge and how much heat will be generated in the process. To find the current, divide the power (watts) by the voltage. A common example is a 12v, 2W panel. 2/12=0.1666666, so that panel would have a maximum short-circuit current of 0.16666A or 167mA. You could then use that to determine how long it would take to charge your battery if it was fully depleted. To find how long it would take to charge a 12v, 1Ah battery, we would divide 1Ah by 0.16666A and we would get 6 hours.

Probably the reason you couldn't  find an answer is because you were searching for the wrong thing; there is no such thing as battery wattage, and the ""wattage"" of the system depends essentially on the load, however different parts of the system will have different wattages if you want to put it that way. In reality, there are many parameters to be aware of and wattage might be the least important thing. There are also many hazards present when dealing with batteries and solar energy, so you really need to understand what you are doing. For example, if you use the wrong type of battery or charge it the wrong way (as in for too long or too fast) it may catch on fire or explode. If you short the battery you can cause an arc flash which can kill you. Those arc flashes can send hundreds or thousands of amps through your body depending on the size of the battery. 

I am currently working on some solar projects, if you elaborate on what you are trying to do I can probably help you. 

",1464925354
63,TheRealFalconFlurry,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The supply company cannot tell what devices you are using, they can only tell how much energy you are using at any given time, as well as the overall power factor your house is running at. A smart meter likely has a power analyzer in it which could determine power factor. Power factor is a simple concept, but it requires a fairly advanced electrical background to understand, so I won't go into too much detail about it.

Basically power factor is a ratio between how much power is being supplied to a load (your house) and how much power is actually available for your house to use. 

 There are three types of electrical loads: Resistive, Inductive, Capacitive and any combination thereof. Each type of load affects the power factor in a different way. Purely resistive loads generate a unity power factor which is the best you can have, all the power you are paying for is being used. Most heaters are purely resistive if they do not include a fan. Inductive loads are rarely purely inductive, they are usually inductive-resistive and the inductive portion creates wasted power, this can be detected by the smart meter. Some examples are transformers and motors. Anything that has a motor in it will be an inductive load. It is very hard to make a purely inductive load, but the closest you could get would be a coil of wire or a basic transformer. Capacitive loads also generate waste power but the waste power generated is opposite to inductive power and thus they can cancel each other out. Capacitive loads often have no resistance and can be considered purely capacitive and therefore are useful for power factor correction.

A teacher of mine once gave a good analogy, he compared it to beer. He said that your true power is the amount of beer in a mug, the reactive power (useless power consumed by inductive and capacitive loads) is the foam and the apparent power (total amount of useful and useless power, also what the power company charges you for) is equal to the size of the mug. If you have a pint of beer and pour it really fast into a mug it's gonna make a lot of foam and you will not be able to fit very much beer into the mug, which sucks because the beer is the good stuff that you want and the foam is useless, but you are still paying for the whole mug, but if you pour the beer properly you can fill most of the mug with beer and only have a little foam, in that case you are mostly getting what you pay for. Power factor can be brought into this analogy as the ratio of beer to mug size; the closer the volume of beer is to the size of the mug, the better your power factor is. Because most loads that aren't resistive are inductive, you can correct the power factor of your house by adding capacitive loads such as capacitors in at the supply panel. This would be beneficial because it would reduce your power bill because you wouldn't be paying for any waste power, it would also create a power factor  close to 1 which would make the meter think your house is mostly resistive loads such as heaters and lights. Typically this is not done in a house because...well...it's frankly not something most people know about and it would take some electrical know-how and expensive equipment to size the equipment properly and install it correctly. This is something that is very common in industrial applications however.

In terms of frequency, you can change the frequency of a system with something called a VFD (variable frequency drive), however these are typically only used to control motor speed and using one in your house would not solve anything. In fact, it would make things much worse. Most devices rely on a steady frequency to operate and many would be destroyed if you messed with the frequency. Additionally, VFDs have a tendency to generate harmonic frequencies and reflected waves which can travel down the line back to the supply company and cause disruptions and equipment damage on their end. If that happens, your will increase your odds of being caught because the next step will be for them to investigate the source of the harmonic disruptions and it will lead them right to your house. Then they will want to know what it is that you are doing that is causing those problems. So, don't mess with the frequency, ever. 

As far as portable power goes, you could do that, however being that a grow light generates as much heat as it does light, they generally consume a crap-load of power. you would have to cover your entire roof with solar panels and spend a fortune on batteries in order to make that work.

Also, a surge protector has nothing to do with anything that you are wondering about, it probably couldn't be less related...just so you know.",1464927777

Do you have any specific interests in EE? (Circuits, high voltage, energy generation, programming, etc.)


When I was around your age I was interested in robotics. I remember finding a couple kits where you build a small ""robot"" which included soldering the circuit board. I always thought soldering circuit boards was fun and it's definitely a skill that needs to be developed.

To join, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee (I think it's pretty cheap for students). Spend some time looking to see if there is a student branch or IEEE society meetings near you as these would be the most beneficial to get you in contact with people that share the same interests as you. Aside from networking at meetings, you'll also get access to IEEE standards and a monthly magazine, Potentials, that has some really interesting articles every now and then. IEEE standards can be pretty dry so I'm not sure how much benefit you'd get out of having access to them. Although if you're of curious nature I'm sure there are plenty that would interest you.

The objective of that is so each house or office or business in that lot/building are connected to those bars (that come from the general supply outside) in a balanced manner, meaning each bar should have the same load as to not to cause what's happening to you.

It could also be related to improper wiring installation, as this been happening always? recently? in the last X years? when an engineer lays a project they should calculate voltage drop... things that cause voltage to drop? not having the right wiring (mostly the ""girth"") and mostly distance.

100,Larius_Vopek,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I'll try to explain it for you.

First Step: Voltage is known as Electric Potential Difference. 

I'll use the way that my teacher explained to me.

When you are on the top of an build and stay on the edge. This time you have the potential to fall out, and the Work realized is 'x'. Use the top of the building like the Potential 1 and the floor like the Potential 0. Then, you downstairs and stay on the window of the apartment below. You still have the potential to fall out, but the Work realized 'x1' drop, i.e., x1 &lt; x.

If you are on the floor looking up to the to of the building, you don't have the potential to fall, so, you will not have work realized.

Understandind the Voltage like the potential to realized work, we can answer your questions.

1 - Because of the potential difference, remember my example. The resistor is like a barrier, 'crossing' the resistor you are decreasing the potential, not losting. When the Voltage reaches 0 the current not cease to flow, it will depends of the circuit, for example: when we have a short-circuit, the voltage go to 0 and e current rises. But in another case, if you don't have potential difference, the electrons will not have the """"""""""will"""""""""" to move, because you don't have any force acting on they.

2 - Ordinarily, the resistance stays constant, just in some cases it will increase or decrease, the variable use to be the current and the voltage. If you increase resistance, your current will increase as well and the Voltage will drop. But if you maintain the Voltage level, you current will drop.

3 - The current will decrease. This time your Voltage source still constant. Unless you increase a lot of resistance, then your source will decrease too.

4 - I answered this in topic 3.

I hope I could help you.

assuming that my numbers are correct, you just have to think about how long you want to be able to run things for. like if you left everything on for an hour you'd use 1695 watt-hours (1.695 kWh). solar panels are usually around 300 watts each so in terms of sizing the system you'd want to think about how long you're running things, how much sunlight you get, and how long you want to be able to run just on solar/battery. 

batteries are usually speced in terms of both capacity (kWh) and max output (kW) so you'd want to be able to serve probably 2 kW in order to fully cover your usage and then it's just a matter of how long you want it to be able to last. cost/benefit question. 

once you have a rough idea of what you want then it's probably time to seek out a residential solar developer or an electrician who's experienced with solar. it's completely possible to rig up a system yourself and you can get real redneck with it and just use old car batteries but you really need someone who knows what they're doing. electricity isn't something where you want to take an approach like ""meh it'll probably be fine"".",1555943031

It is important to look at the curves for different current drains. (Kirchhoff's circuit laws) For instance in your 1.25A example you will only get about 900 mah. So your lamps will only run for about 43 minutes.  In actual use you will probably get somewhat more, because as the battery runs down it will begin to take less current (and the LED's dim). I am assuming the LED's are run with a resistor ballast for this. If they use a DC/DC converter to run them, then you will have to use the constant power curve. Because the converter compensates for declining battery voltage by increasing current draw to keep the LED's at a steady 5W (5000mW). Which for your example is off the chart to the right.

Basically we're just making so many that it's becoming crazy cheap to make them, so even if a ""better"" technology comes along it is unlikely to be able to compete.

Bio-fuels aren't green for the most part because agriculture is so energy/carbon intensive. For instance, you'll often hear people say that it takes two barrels of oil to make one barrel of ethanol... I don't have the exact figures on me, but that's pretty much the long and short of it.

A solar installation of the grid tied variety where you will be attached to the utility is 100% useless in a utility outage for line worker safety.  So when they are offline, you will not be able to use your panels to power your house, and even then with a grid tied system with no batteries allowed for storage the output of the panels via the AC inverter will do little to maintain your power usage in real time. 

If you have an off grid system involving expensive battery storage, this will help you maintain power when a utility outage occurs then but for the rest of the year, you are not recouping any costs from the most expensive option (off grid solar versus grid tied or generator).

141,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"One of the things they have been doing since the late 1960's is using **DC high voltage lines** for long distance power transmission. (Edison must be laughing in his grave). It is more efficient than the conventional AC lines you see around. This helps in improving remote siting.

It was the transformer that originally made AC current less lossy with distance. Transformers can be very near 100% efficient. They allow efficient step up to high voltages (like 100-500 thousand volts), the current drops in proportion. Thereby reducing the P loss=RI^2 losses in long distance lines. Especially note that the loss is a squared term with current! Half the current and quarter the loss! Reduce the current by a thousand times and reduce the loss by a million! (120,000 volts verses 120 volts) It is then just as easy and efficient to drop it back down to a low voltage for the local user.

AC suffers some losses that DC does not. Like power factor, skin effect, and radiation losses. Because of modern efficient solid state conversion circuits, They are now using DC for long distance transmission of electricity. These circuits make the voltage level changes easy with transformers and conversion between AC &amp; DC equally easy. These methods did not exist before the 1960's. Certainly not in Edison's time.

Again for efficiency. Virtually all modern computer power supplies and many CFL and LED fixtures will work perfectly fine off of 320 Volts DC! In fact the first thing they do in modern power supplies is rectify the AC to DC at 160-400 volts internally. It turns out all modern devices that use switched mode power supplies work perfectly well on a DC supply. In server farms they need UPS backup (batteries). So they simply use primary 200-400VDC, from charged battery banks, to supply power buses. They get rid of a lot of the aforementioned losses, as well as the losses of converting the UPS batteries to AC just to turn it back to DC in the computer supply.

Here's an example: http://directpowertech.com/docs/LEONARDO%20ENERGY.pdf

150,parametrek,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Galvanic cells and voltaic cells and chemical cells are the same thing.

Electrolytic cells have 2 definitions.  One type is exactly the same as a galvanic cell and spontaneously produces current.  The other type is non-spontaneous.  That is it requires an external source of electricity to cause a chemical reaction.

&gt; What type of cells are the standard AA alkaline and what type are the typical Li-Ion (Like 18650's)?

All are galvanic/voltaic/chemical cells.

&gt; And let's say each cell has a voltage of 1.5 volts. Now if you created a bunch of these cells and linked them in series

These do exist.  They were more common 70 years ago for vacuum tube electronics that required extremely high plate voltages.  If you've ever wondered ""Why isn't there a B battery?"" there is such a thing as a B battery.  It was a 90 volt battery for portable vacuum tube radios.

&gt; Now I realize the problem with this is that the amperage would be low, but lets say that you add a D or C cell, or even even 2 D cells at the end.

You can't do that.  Well you can but it doesn't do anything.  To put it simply the current is restricted by the weakest link in the chain.",1556806334
151,coherent-rambling,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"An electrochemical cell is pretty much any device where electricity and chemical reactions interact.

""Galvanic cell"" and ""Voltaic cell"" are equivalent names for a specific type of electrochemical cell which produces electricity from a chemical reaction. All batteries, whether alkaline, carbon-zinc, lithium-ion, or something else, are galvanic cells.

An electrolytic cell is the opposite type of electrochemical cell, which takes in electricity to drive a particular chemical reaction. Sometimes this is an industrial process like generating hydrogen or electroplating. Also, a rechargeable battery or cell is operating as an electrolytic cell, but *only while being charged*.

Now, to address your hypothetical battery question, you need to consider a couple key elements:

1. The total power a cell can produce (watts, or volts times amps) is roughly proportional to the size of the cell, at least compared to other cells of the same chemistry.
1. The same current flows through all points in a series circuit.
1. Cells in series add voltage, but the string has the sum of their internal resistances and has the capacity of the weakest cell.

Now, do you see where those apply to your battery idea? In order to get 787 watts from your mismatched string of cells, all the tiny cells have to produce, and carry, the same 10 amps as the 18650 on the end. If they could do this, there would be no point in adding the 18650; what will actually happen is you'll find the 18650 limited by the internal resistance of the little cells and you'll have a 78.7 volt string capable of 0.001 mA. It'll also only have the effective capacity of the small cells; once those are discharged the 18650 will still have energy left, but the pack voltage will have dropped to 3.7 volts and the 18650 will be trying to reverse-charge all the little dead cells.",1556807709

154,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Careers:
EE is a very wide field with lots of specific expertise.  There’s jobs in lots of different fields.  When considering career paths, I’d suggest evaluating the questions “where do I want to live?”  and “can someone in Asia do this job for half to a quarter of the price without impacting the end product?” and “How much am I willing to travel?” before setting my heart on a path.  Those are incredibly important questions that will impact both your career and lifestyle far more than what you decide to actually work -on-.

Some main disciplines to consider: 
Radio Frequency / (RF) - 
this is working on wireless communications for the most part and may include antenna design, designing / planning retrofits to existing sites (tower), a radar assembly for a vehicle, fitting an antenna into a personal electronic device, designing a low power consumption / low weight wireless system for a satellite, or something like that.  Some of these jobs involve a lot of travel to remote locations to inspect a radio site.  Many involve working in a larger city for a large firm. Some involve working for a local television or radio station and allow you to find a job almost anywhere. 

Power Engineering - 
This is where I work.  Electrical systems designed to deliver energy instead of information to end users.  This may include facility management at generation facilities like dams, nuclear generation facilities, fossil fuel plants, solar / wind farm design, and all the other ways we convert energy into electricity out of the natural world. It might be working on cross country transmission line systems to ensure it is sufficient to meet the needs of the next 10-50 years and what millions must be spent to correct any shortfalls found, working on the sprawling distribution system with its many special cases and related equipment, or designing power delivery systems for commercial buildings like factories, hospitals, or even power plants and radio facilities.  These jobs can be found anywhere people use power, that is to say, everywhere.  There’s jobs in big cities, some extremely remote locations, and lots of small to medium sized cities. 

Digital Systems -
For these jobs you’d largely be designing computing hardware intended to gather and process information.  Most of the jobs are going to be in a large city, but not necessarily all of them.  Designing these components to be mass produced will be a chief concern so cost versus benefit will be a huge factor in deciding how you design a circuit.  Perhaps this one IC does everything you’d like with low power consumption but this other one consumes a little bit more power, lacks a few features to be maybe used in the future, and is 20 cents cheaper (when you’re making millions of units, 20 cents is real money).  A lot of these jobs overlap with computer engineering, software engineering, you’ll find all three disciplines to be related in this field of work.  

Computer programming -
Now this is not necessarily EE but a related field.  Computer engineering / software engineering / computer science.  EE and computer engineering will be focused most on programming the logic circuits of a digital system to ensure it is capable of performing the task it is designed for.  Often these programming tasks are related to a larger system that performs a specific task.  For example: specify an IC and design software for that IC for handling communications between these three interdependent systems with differing data needs. 

I invite other experts to weigh in, refute, expand, or correct those extremely broad strokes.  It’s intended to just give you a feel of what a career in EE might involve. 

Let’s talk about school now, how to get there.
School will be difficult.  
I know of only an extremely small few incredibly diligent and intelligent people that could grasp and breeze through the EE program with low effort.  If you have developed good study habits: that is doing required reading, working through the homework, watching / reading / seeking outside curriculum related information to better understand the material you are already halfway to victory.  If, instead, high school has been an easy breeze and you have not developed good study habits you will be forced to learn how to study or you will wash out.  The material is tough, sometimes you will find questions that we, humans, have an insufficient understanding to answer fully but we know enough to approximate what is happening.  Sometimes the text books are unbelievably obtuse in explaining core concepts.  You will not be partying on the weekends.  You will be doing homework, studying, or writing a paper.  

You and the Physicists will take practically all of the advanced mathematics classes.  

You’ll learn how to write detailed research papers, gain an understanding of physics, and dip your toe into each of the major fields of Electrical Engineering.   There’s a ton of material to cover so whatever career you pick, figure by the time you graduate you will have a basic toolbox of physics, math, and electrical calculations at your disposal and 1 to 2 semesters of specialty class covering your career.  The rest will have to be learned on the job.   

After graduation:
After you graduate you’ll huff a sigh of relief that all of that BS is done and have a head the size of a watermelon.  You’ll get a job and learn that the real world is incredibly complicated and there’s a lot of things about it that school just didn’t and couldn’t possibly cover.  You’ll need to learn to listen to and respect the opinions of people, including and especially non-engineers, who have been working in that field for years and possibly decades because they actually have had years of on-the-job practical experience.  Don’t go into your first job thinking you’re the hottest slice of brisket, because you probably know just enough to be useful eventually but not enough to matter right now.  You’ll also learn that most of that incredibly soul crushing math that you did in college is done by expensive task specific software and that while it’s important to understand where the math is coming from the days of rote calculation by hand are behind you.  You’ll also have nightmares about college for years afterward, missing a class, forgetting a test, forgetting a class.  

About me:
I finished going through the EE program about 10 years ago.  About 2 years into college I switched majors from computer science to EE.  I work in the power industry.  I love the work I do and encourage anyone with the aptitude and desire to pursue this career.",1556819783
155,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It’s also worth considering getting involved in a college special group that’s doing some project that interests you.  

A few years ago there was a solar car competition that my buddy was involved in. He made some good contacts with industry folks and had some good practical application work under his belt long before he had classes that properly taught the material that made the preparation for classes on his part much easier.  

A good GPA is attractive to employers but some practical experience in working on a project outside of curricular work can be what sets you apart from the other candidates.  

You can do it, there’ll be times when you question your sanity but at the end of the program it’s extremely satisfying knowing there’s a job waiting for you somewhere. When I graduated we had about 160 people exiting the program and only 28 of them weren’t foreign.  Both degrees are in high demand.

Pf is cos(Θ) where Θ is the angle difference between the voltage and the current.

The typical commercial Taser does a two step energy transfer. This is because it is difficult to get the peak power that drives the spark from just a battery alone. Typically they use a DC/DC converter to charge up a capacitor to an intermediate high voltage. Like hundreds to a few thousand. Then that capacitor is switched (dumped) into a second step up transformer where you get the 100,000 volts. And those ratings of 100,000 to 500,000 volts is what is called the open circuit voltage. That is necessary to jump through a thick layer of clothing. But once the spark contacts the skin, the voltage drops to maybe only a few thousand and only lasts a few hundred microseconds per pulse. This also helps to control the energy per pulse delivered. If you could sustain it, the person would literally explode from the power dissipation.

You will find all kinds of schematic diagrams online. but ones like this are what are typically used. Basically battery converted to a few hundred volts (via T1), charges a capacitor (the 400 volt one), then is dumped via T2 to output.

181,JustSomeCanuck101,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt; I thought incandescents had a life span closer to 3 years.

Sure, that will be the case if the (1000hr) bulb is only used for about one hour per day, which is not out of question at all.  Most bulbs have an expected lifespan printed on the packaging (I think?), so you could check there to confirm the 1000 total in service value that I used.  Of course other factors play a role as well - physical vibration can take its toll on bulb life as well as number of OFF/ON cycles.

&gt; I live in a small farm town, but don't get brown outs very often but more than the city for sure.

That (rural setting) might also be a factor in your case, although maybe not so much for the reason that you hinted at (brownouts).  If you poke around in the lighting aisle at your local Home Depot or Home Hardware or whatever you might stumble across 'special' incandescent bulbs known as Rural Bulbs.  Those bulbs are designed to operate on slightly higher voltages, voltages that can often be found in rural settings.  In town it seems to be easier for the utility distribution companies to design/operate their systems so that the voltage available to residential consumers is right in the 115 to 120 VAC range.  AFAIK, out in the country the distribution line losses can be more of a factor, so occasionally the distribution companies will end up stepping up voltages on their system so that the folks at the far end of the line don't receive too low of a voltage.  But that means that people who are just down stream of the step up equipment might receive a voltage that is closer to 125 or even 130 VAC.  Obviously you could locate a meter and check your voltage anywhere in your home.

The 2700K bulbs are way to yellow for my liking (candle light yellow), and the 5000K bulbs are way to white/harsh (like the traditional flourescent tubes).  The 3000K bulbs are just right, very bright but with a very slight yellow, warm tinge.  The 3000K bulbs are hard to find though - not sure if they just sell out quickly or if fewer of them are made/in demand.",1473867875

183,Sparky2121,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"1) Why does voltage ""Drop"" across a resistor?

Answer: As the name states, the resistor uses a bit of electrons which is dissipates as heat, which will use up some voltage to overcome the resistance depending on how big the resistor is. (E.g.) If you have a 1000 Volts A/C and a 100 Ohms resistor, It will obviously blow the resistor up because of the high heat dissipation (this is why 120 Volts appliances blows up when plugged it at a higher voltage) The Electrons from a 240 V Plug cannot be used up fast enough by a 120 Volt appliance, so it tries to use it up as heat, which as you know, an over heating an appliance will eventually blow up.

""the voltage reaches 0 does the current cease to flow?"" Kirchhoff Law states that the voltage drop on all resistors should be equal to the source voltage. Without Voltage, Current will not flow. they go hand in hand.

2. Is it just that the total voltage in a system MUST increase if resistance is increased, if amperage stays constant, in order to have the energy to push that same current through the load/resistance?
 
Answer: This can be determined by using Ohms Law (V(voltage)= I(Amps) x R(resistance)) If Voltage is constant and Amp increase, resistance Decrease. If Voltage is Constant and Resistance Increase, Amps Decrease. To answer your question, Yes Voltage needs to be increase to keep your Amps constant.

3)When a batteries of 1.5v is hooked up to a circuit and you increase resistance does the voltage source (batteries voltage) increase? Or is the amperage just decreased to accommodate for the added resistance?

Answer: Voltage Never increase or decrease with DC batteries or A/C Voltage, It's always the Amps that change to accommodate the change in resistance. 

4) Will a voltage source generally stay constant?

Answer: Yes!!

188,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Since the computer needs several voltages, most used today besides the 5v, 12v are 3.3v, 1.2v, among others. since they need to be well regulated you could not just run them directly off of a DC supply. They use switch mode DC to DC converters to make and regulate those voltages. The incoming power line is converted to anywhere between 170 and 400 VDC by rectifiers or voltage doublers. The most efficient way of powering a modern computer or display is then by direct DC to the convertors. Bypassing the AC to DC conversion. The most straight forward way of doing this is to make the solar array and battery bank ~200-400 volts DC.  Many modern server farms are done this way.

But I would not recommend you do it. Since you have to even ask this question you would be at great risk in trying that. DC is more dangerous than AC at the same voltage. Not from shocks, but from arc flash faults. Everything you would use (switches, fuses, etc) MUST be rated for 170-400 VDC. Anything above 32 volts and especially above 100VDC requires electrical components, like switches, circuit breakers, and connectors that are rated for DC service. You CANNOT NOT use ordinary parts that were just made for 120-240 VAC.

Specifically, YOU CANNOT USE the electrical devices that are normally used for AC systems. They make specially designed ones for HVDC. And HVDC includes anything much over 48 VDC. Basically the problem with DC is that the current is continuous. AC current crosses zero twice per cycle. So an arc that forms when a switch or fuse opens tends to sustain on DC. In AC the zero crossings allows the arc to cool enough to stop.

As far as EMF radiation is concerned, people also forget that there are radio waves all around you passing through your body at all times. The lights in your home shine visible light all around you. The sun shines UV rays on you all the time. [You even get small amounts of radiation just from being next to a person or eating a banana \(radiation dosage exposure chart\).](https://xkcd.com/radiation/)

On the electromagnetic spectrum, [it's not until you get past UV rays \(from the sun\) and step up into x-rays that it starts being a health hazard \(Article from the Center for Disease Control\).](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/ionizing_radiation.html) That's the point that the electromagnetic waves carry enough power to ionize atoms and molecules (essentially, x-rays carry enough energy to be able to knock an electron out of orbit of an atom, changing its structure). Nothing of lower frequency on the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves, microwaves, visible light, etc. referred to as non-ionizing radiation) has enough power to do this, so therefore it is not harmful to your health in any way. You could sleep next to a radio tower and although it might interfere with your electronics, it won't cause your body any adverse health problems.

Household electricity emits what is known as ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) radiation. It is an even lower frequency and less energetic than radio waves.

So, to answer your question, yes, but also no. A 9V battery is definitely powerful enough to *power* a taser, but 9V to a capacitor won't do anything in terms of shocking people. If you hook up a capacitor straight up to the 9V, you'll just have 9V stored. If you push a 9V against your skin does it shock you? It shouldn't unless you're licking it. And even that doesn't hurt too bad.

What you'll need is either a boost converter or a flyback converter between the battery and the capacitor. They both function in similar ways, but I'll try to keep it as simple as I can without taking away from the information: 

When you push electrons through a coil, they generate a magnetic field. When power stops being applied, this magnetic field acts like a spring, pushing voltage back through the coil. This creates a surge in voltage which goes through a diode and charges the capacitor. The diode functions like a one-way check valve, letting voltage in but preventing it from going backwards.

Now, in order to do this efficiently, the voltage going to the coil has to switch very fast, in the kilohertz or higher. This is usually done with a transistor and an oscillator of some sort. This can get complicated if you're designing it from scratch, but lucky for you, they sell these premade.

You know those shock pens/prank gum where they push the pen down or pull the gum out and it shocks them? This is powered by a boost converter, and it usually uses a coin cell. Likewise, a camera flash circuit is upwards of 200-300V and is powered by a single AAA battery.

Alternators, by contrast, have fixed coils and rotating magnets, this allows for the design to work better across multiple rpm ranges, because the coil isn't subjected to centripetal/centrifugal forces. Alternators work better at or close to idle engine rpm.

Dielectric loss quantifies a dielectric material's inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).

Both refer to the phasor in the complex plane whose real and imaginary parts are the resistive (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its reactive (lossless) counterpart.

**Eddy current**

Eddy currents (also called Foucault's currents) are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field in the conductor according to Faraday's law of induction.   Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet or transformer, for example, or by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor.  The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the material.

&amp;#x200B;

The brightness of the light is a function of the power consumed by it.  Assuming the resistance is constant (which isn't quite right, but won't effect this scenario much) then the power the light uses is I\^2\*R. 

These quotes are from here:  [https://opentextbc.ca/physicstestbook2/chapter/back-emf/](https://opentextbc.ca/physicstestbook2/chapter/back-emf/) 

&gt; Back emf is the generator output of a motor, and so it is proportional to the motor’s angular velocity. It is zero when the motor is first turned on, meaning that the coil receives the full driving voltage and the motor draws maximum current when it is on but not turning. As the motor turns faster and faster, the back emf grows, always opposing the driving emf, and reduces the voltage across the coil and the amount of current it draws. 

One the motor is running at a steady state the current in the circuit is essentially (supply voltage - back EMF)/R.

&gt; When a mechanical load is placed on the motor, like an electric wheelchair going up a hill, the motor slows, the back emf drops, more current flows 

When the motor is spinning the fan it is working harder and turning slower.  From the above ""more current flows"" which in turn results in the light being brighter because I\^2\*R is larger.",1559967894

Many things are at play here.

Depending on your level of power generation, you can either connect to a nearby utility grid operating at the low tens of kV, or if your generation is in the megawatts you may need to connect to your nearest high voltage (60-70kV+) substation. Given your distance and power, you pick a voltage level - higher voltage usually means lower losses but a bigger initial investment, and vice versa.

From a power/distribution system perspective, small generation can be very helpful in that if it any consumers are closer to you than the previously closest power plant, it may lead to an overall decrease in transmission losses and help maintain a stable voltage level.

278,NekoLover,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Even big wind parks need backup power. You need to create the same amount of energy you use up. It is true that the power generation won't go to zero. This is especially true for solar panels (asuming it is not complete darkness). Power generation of wind parks can go to zero. They can even start consuming more power than they create. But let's say you create 500kW with renewable sources. And your production gets halved within certain time. Wind direction changes or it gets cloudy. You need to start generating 250kW of power somewhere else asuming your power consumpstion doesn't change. If you do not have backup power generation. Outer loads of your network won't have enough voltage and frequency will drop. On the other hand if you suddenly have too much power. You need to stop generating somewhere else. You cannot just create more power than you need. Generated power has to go somewhere (it flows through the point of lowest resistance). Something would most likely get overloaded and it would burn or get disconected. Both cases can cause power blackouts.

In my opinion. Renewable sources of energy are a great thing but very unpredictable. I don't think we should create more wind and solar parks. We should create many small systems not conected to power network. It is much easier to store energy in batteries on smaller scales. If you have a solar or wind system on your house, you can use energy for heat or something similar.

Best form of renewable source is water. You can turn it on and off as you please. The best power plant for regulation of said negative effects is pumped-storage hydroelectric plant. If you suddenly have surplus of power, you start pumping water into the reservoir. And when you suddenly need more power you start generating.

TLDR: renewable power sources are too unpredictable but with correct use and technology you can mitigate those effects.

I am just a student of electro-energistics at university. Some things I say may not be entirely correct but mostly it should be ok.

Edit to answer the second question. I don't think it is possible for region to be only powered by renewable resources. They are too unstable. You need something else to make it work nicely togethe.

If the meter is designed badly, sound can cause parts to flex resulting in noise in the meter. Also, with certain materials, they can generate voltages based on pressure changes (piezoelectric effect, triboelectric effect, etc.) but these materials tend to be very specialized (either in type or structure) and the effects from sound acting upon them tend to be very small.

Light (which I will lump infrared and ultraviolet in with) can generate voltages via the photoelectric effect on certain metals and semiconductors (but certainly not water).

Not sure on the frequency we fill them. It's probably checked at least once every six months to a year. (As maintenance is needed.) Basically we need to keep the anodes and cathodes submerged.

337,spill_drudge,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Voltage is like energy. If you've got 10 V you've got a bunch of energy to do stuff with. There's TWO KEY differences!!

1. Energy you have some TOTAL amount, say 10 'energy', and then whatever is using that energy, that's it, the amount you have is 10. With voltage it's per 'stuff'. So, it's not the total, but the amount available for each bit of 'stuff' (stuff would be charge for example). So if you had 10 V and you had a little bit of stuff (charges), each little bit gets 10 V (or energy). If you had a lot of stuff, each bit gets 10 V (energy). So the total amount of energy is always V times charges! 

2. Energy is always relative to something, but often we take that for granted. For voltage we can't do that. So, for example, I have 10 'energy', and if we're talking about a moving car the 10 is relative to objects not moving. If another car is moving with it and also has 10 energy, they have 0 comparing to each other. Again. The 10 is relative to not moving objects (like the ground), and here's the thing, often we're so experienced we percieve the context or we intuit it so we almost forget. This is where in electricity you can't intuit it and so it needs to be defined each and every time. For example, a battery says 9 V; the maker is saying, see this nub with (+), that's compared (or relative) to the part that's labeled (-)!!! So 9V from the (+) relative to the (-) and not (+) to your socket, or tree in the yard or whatever.

[WTF is Voltage?](http://amasci.com/miscon/voltage.html)

Potentials are a lot like altitude.    Potentials are ""distance along a force field.""

If you hear someone saying that voltage is ""potential to do x,"" or is the ""potential for something or other""  ...don't listen.    They have no idea what voltage is.   ""Potentials Theory"" is actually a terrible name, since it misleads everyone into thinking that it has something to do with the human concept of ""potential for doing something.""

Theory Of Potentials is about fields, and fields are genuine entities.  We've recognized this since the time of Faraday/Maxwell.

In particular, if we remove the test-charge, the Potentials are still here, hanging weirdly in space.    The test-charge is a way to *measure* potentials, and to calibrate the Potentials against the PE.   But take away the PE, and the voltage is still there (the e-field is still there, even with no test-charge.)

More familiar:  gravitational potentials are part of the gravity field.   They don't involve potential energy.   However, if we roll a boulder down a hill, Potential Energy may be calculated if we know the mass of the boulder and the pattern of Potentials.   In other words, gravity has nothing to do with potential energy:   gravity fields are a genuine thing, all on their own.    (The same is true of magnetic fields and electric fields., and the pattern of Potentials we use to measure them.)

Another tack:  the flux of any field is not about potential energy.  The flux is a way to measure and describe fields.   The same is true of Potentials:  The equipotentials are like stacked membranes, while the flux is like parallel fibers.   Both are ways to describe fields.",1561846116

I wasn't challenging the principles you cited, but your interpretation of them. By definition, of course we can have potentials when the potential energy is zero - like I said, voltage is a measure of the potential difference *between two points*, so while the potential between two points might be zero there will still be potential between those points and some other point, which might well be relevant to whatever situation you're analysing. Potentials are everywhere, what matters is where you're measuring them.

Of course fields exist, and of course imaginary (or reactive) power is a very real thing (not that you've touched on that). Your field analysis falls apart when you ""take away the PE""; in this situation you are removing the half of the equation you're analysing and the reason you're analysing it - you're taking an example of *an interaction between* a **point charge** and a **field** and removing the point charge; of course the field is still there, it was there to begin with, by your initial definition, and so you have proven nothing. You're just saying ""there is a **thing**, and here is *another thing*; we're taking that *2nd thing* away and now there is just that **1st thing**"". You've made two measurements of potential, discarded the 2nd measurement and said there is still a measurement. You're not wrong, but you've not quite reached a solution.

Gravitational potentials are dependent on distance, not so much altitude, but they are analogous; they are a similar principle expressed a different way. There is a potential energy, only the energy is dependent on mass and it gets a bit quantum and....... that's another story. But gravity is heavily dependent on distance - voltage is dependent on distance, as well. When you go up to higher voltages, anything above 66kV, the separation distance between transmission line conductors goes up as the potential difference in energy levels is so high that it can ionise the air between the conductors and create a short circuit - the air insulator breaks down, so you need a thicker insulator to separate the circuits because the voltage is greater and the potential difference between the conductors is higher. At voltages of 33kV and below, conductor separation is dictated by the wingspan of local birds.

Honestly though, it's really difficult to reconcile what you're saying. It's like you're describing wave/particle duality by saying they are neither of those things at the same time, instead of saying they are both of those things at the same time.

Here's a question for you to scratch your brain on, as an aside: how do magnets work?",1561854765

&gt; No, your hoover will still always spin the same direction. It's because of the physical connections in the motor and the locations of the brushes.

&gt; No single phase motor will reverse simply by swapping phase and neutral.

That's not true, at least not with a permanent magnet motor. When the motor is at rest, it will rest at a position dictated by the magnetic interaction of the stator and the rotor, as well as the rotor's interaction with gravity. That is, the rotor will lean against the stator, one side or another. When the motor is energised the magnetic field will push it in one direction or the other, depending on which side it was initially leaning against, and also depending on the polarity - if you energise the live with the positive half of the wave cycle the magnetic polarity will push one way initially and if you energise with the negative half it will go the other way.

A human body can be 500 to 10k ohms, shoes can range from a few ohms to a few million ohms, and your flooring can range from just a few ohms to a few million ohms. It takes on the order of 100mA of current across the heart to stop it. Since V=IR, if V=120 then for I to be more than 100mA, R would have to be less than 1200 ohms. It just so happened that your combination of shoes, flooring, and body was high enough that it didn't allow sufficient current to flow through you to kill you. (this all assumes that you touched a single wire at 120V, and the only path for the circuit to flow was through your body, shoes, and floor. The path changes if you're leaning against a metal object, standing on a metal ladder, or touching 2 wires at the same time)

All of that being said, the given resistance values can go toward zero pretty quick when water, sweat, metal, or other highly conductive materials are in the path between you and ground, so you really don't want to mess around with electricity without taking the right precautions (i.e. turning it off before working on it, and not working on it if you don't know what you're doing).",1479438532
368,moldboy,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"There's one reason it seems low (and there are several reasons it is low):

1) It seems low because you are used to seeing cell phone batteries listed in mAh, and ~5000mAh is ""big"".  So this is only 10 times larger but the power consumption is much much higher.  This is because cell phone batteries are rated at 3.7 (ish) volts.  You rated yours at 12, so it needs to be 3-4 times larger.  A better comparison would be watt-hours.  Most laptop batteries are rated in watt-hours since they are multicell and the voltage is a function of their design and not just intrinsic to their chemistry.  (That's why it seems low).  It is low because:

2) The math assumes there are no losses.  The question for OP is do you need 120W at the light, or into the light.  If you need it into the light then the light bar itself will draw extra power in conversion.  If you need it at the light then you'll need some kind of circuit to regulate (boost or buck) the battery voltage to 12V.  That will also introduce losses.  They say 80% is ""good"".  I'd figure for worse than that.

3) Batteries almost never output their rated voltage.  A 12V ""car"" battery is charged at 14.4V and after being removed from the charger (while under load) rapidly falls to close to 12V and then more slowly continues to fall.  The aforementioned buck or boost circuit will eventually be unable to regulate the battery voltage to your system voltage and will fail (dead battery) even though the battery still has energy left in it.  Think of it like a pail of ice cream.  A 1gal container holds a gallon of ice cream.  But if you only have a big clunky spoon you won't be able to get the ice cream from the corners so you won't be able to eat all of the gallon, the pail is essentially empty even though there's still ice cream in it.

My high school electricity teacher told us a story about his journeyman who would test live light sockets by sticking his thumb inside and feeling a tingle if they were live. He tried it himself one day and really got a strong shock and discovered that the journeyman could do this because of a very thick callous on his thumb. 
However, I can relate a story about a friend who was stripping a live wire and his hand clamped tight on the strippers which stuck him to the live wire,  he probably was not on there long, 20 seconds, I guess, but when I heard him hit the ground and went running upstairs I found him curled up , glassy eyed, and panting, he looked like hell.

Electrofishing uses direct current electricity flowing between a submerged cathode and anode.

When performed correctly, electrofishing results in no permanent harm to fish, which return to their natural state in as little as two minutes after being caught.

As required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has established test procedures and energy conservation standards for ceiling fans and for ceiling fan light kits.

Ceiling fan light kits with any other socket type including but not limited to candelabra screw base sockets, intermediate screw-base sockets, 2-pin halogen sockets, and bayonet sockets manufactured on or after January 1, 2009, shall not be capable of operating with lamps that total more than 190 watts and must be packaged with lamps that together total 190 watts or less. DOE indicated in a January 11, 2007, final rule that it recognizes that manufacturers may choose to follow one of several possible design pathways to ensure that the light kit is not capable of operating with lamps that total more than 190 watts.

http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EERE-2006-TP-0121-0003

DOE is interpreting the 190-watt limit on power consumption for certain ceiling fan light kits as a design requirement. This approach will require that manufacturers incorporate some measure such as a fuse, circuit breaker or current-limiting device to ensure the light kit is not capable of operating with a lamp or lamps totaling more than 190 watts.

Please send a up vote.
",1481164972
419,NotDavidWooderson,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Well, It limited the power all right, it limited to none!

I bypassed the power limiter (threw it in the trash), and the light is working fine again.  I also cut out the pull chain switch in the process of troubleshooting, which is better anyway, since I have separate wall switches for the light and fan speed.  The chain is redundant, and just confuses things. 

The light kit has three candleabra sockets, each labled ""40W Max"".  It's too bad when we have to idiotproof everything like this case, where the stickers aren't enough, we need a wattage limiter, too.  Next thing you know, we'll have DRM in the bulb to make sure the power limiter wasn't bypassed.  

Thanks for the detailed response.  I'm not sure if this government regulation is intended to save energy, enhance safety, or both, but I do know that it added to the cost of the fan, and when the cheap part failed, my kid was without a light for a month before I could get to it, and it wasted a lot of my time.  I tested the wall switch, the pull switch, light bulbs, and almost threw the darn thing out and ordered a new $55 light kit.

440,Ramin_HAL9001,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"There are so many reasons for why electric cars are not more common. The biggest reason is probably because it is always difficult to upset a well-established, well-understood incumbent technology -- in this case, the incumbent technology is fossil fuel.

The business ecosystem of oil and oil-consuming technology has had over a century to evolve, it is big, complicated, and effects tens, perhaps hundreds millions of people and their jobs. You don't just ask them all to suddenly start doing a completely different job with a completely different technology. It takes time to get everyone moving in the direction of electrical energy.

A related question to yours would be this: why don't energy companies and car companies (which currently make most of their money on fossil fuel technology) begin expanding their technology portfolio to include electricity and electric cars?

The answer is probably because the research and development costs of doing that is extremely expensive, and for the time being, oil **appears** to still be cheap and plentiful, so they would have a very hard time explaining their investors why they would suddenly be dumping so much money into switching their tech portfolio over to electricity, so they just don't bother.

The change seems to be coming from the auto industry more than the energy industry. Oil companies just haven't had much reason to develop their electrical technology portfolios, but dozens of major auto makers are starting to build electric cars. This will increase demand for technology like batteries, fast charging stations, and a power-grid upgraded to handle energy consumption from electric cars.

As a result, energy companies that currently deal in oil will begin to see ways to make money from electricity and electric cars, and we will start seeing electric cars become more plentiful.

A transmission tower or power tower (alternatively electricity pylon or variations) is a tall structure, usually a steel lattice tower, used to support an overhead power line.

They are used in high-voltage AC and DC systems, and come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Typical height ranges from 15 to 55 m (49 to 180 ft), though the tallest are the 370 m (1,214 ft) towers of a 2,700 m (8,858 ft) span of Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie.

If you got a strong magnet close enough (within a couple of inches) to the circuitry of the transmitting portion of the device, then it would probably cause some disruption of some kind. This is likely due to the saturation of the inductors, affecting the output variables of the transmitting circuit, rather than directly affecting the RF signal coming from the antenna. 

As far as the RF signal being distorted or affected by the magnet's field, directly, I don't think that this would have much of an effect. This is due to the perpendicular nature of the oscillating electric field vs. the magnetic field. The electric field is oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field is oscillating left to right (simplified explanation).

I don't agree with people who say ""be careful for good habits when you work with HV"", because really you should be prioritizing the actual hazard which is a direct short dissipating energy (fire), and not concerning your time at all being scared of getting shocked. Even touching the wires to your tongue would be an annoying discomfort/pain, zero symptoms after removal.

as for a power supply that can deliver 52 amps - there's plenty out there, any high-end computer power supply basically (I'd go 900+ watts supply assuming your math is correct). Problem is they're not adjustable voltage, which is pretty useless unless you have a good control circuit to cycle the peltier on and off.

Peltiers are resistive devices, so they should be able to self-regulate the power they draw to the point that wiring in paralell isn't a big deal. Managing differences in resistance from one peltier to another, and having thick enough cabling at the right places is a bigger consideration in my opinion. Also don't think of it as 700 watts of cold being generated, think of it as 700 watts of heat you have to dissapate from the hot side of the peltier, that's pretty toasty, and a lot of thought needs to go into how to prevent your setup from just melting down and catching on fire imo.

Edison must be laughing in his grave. DC, IS NOW THE PREFERRED way to send electric power over very long distances.

It was the transformer that originally made AC current less lossy with distance. Transformers can be very near 100% efficient. They allow efficient step up to high voltages (like 100-500 thousand volts), the current drops in proportion. Thereby reducing the I^2*R losses in the long distance lines. Especially note that the loss is a squared term with current! Half the current and quarter the loss! Reduce the current by a thousand times and reduce the loss by a million! (120,000 volts verses 120 volts for example) It is then just as easy and efficient to drop it back down to a low voltage for the local user.

AC suffers some losses that DC does not. Like power factor, skin effect, and radiation losses. Because of modern efficient solid state conversion circuits, They are started in the 1960's and are now using DC for long distance transmission of electricity. These circuits make the voltage level changes easy with transformers and conversion between AC &amp; DC equally easy. These methods did not exist before the 1960's. Certainly not in Edison's time.

Here's an example: http://directpowertech.com/docs/LEONARDO%20ENERGY.pdf

1 Ah means that the energy source can provide a current with an intensity of 1A during 1h, or any multiple combination of it (2A during 1/2h, 37A during (1/37)h, etc.). A/h can't mean anything, if it existed, it would say something like ""an intensity of 1A would have been delivered after 1 hour"", but that can't be as an intensity is a measure of an instantaneous characteristic.

(Edit : in fact, it could be used in an expression such as ""the intensity increases at a rate of 5A/h"", but I'm not involved daily with such units, so I dunno if it exists. It could be used, in the range of milliseconds to seconds, in electronics.)

Same goes for Watt-hours, which are less common than kilowatt-hours (kWh). Those are used in small-scale electricity (think private solar panels and batteries such as Tesla's).

.

To answer more of OP's question :

Cell phone batteries are measured in mAh even though they typically range in the 2,500 - 3,500 mAh range. Typical power banks for phones go up to 10,000 mAh. That said, phones that want to be 'thin and design' may have less, as a typical example the iPhone 6 has 1,810 mAh.

In a simplistic linear vision of the charge (most batteries have a degressive charge, which you'll probably have noticed by your phone charging faster the bottom 10% than the top 10%), but which could give an idea of what to expect, the charge time would simply be : 

([capacity in Ah of the battry]/[current intensity in A of the charge])*(1+[losses]) in hours.

For a life example, [USB 2.0 delivers 5V, 500mA and USB 3.0 delivers 5V, 900mA](http://www.batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_from_a_usb_port) ([power-delivery USB can go higher, but you'll know if you use them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power_related_specifications)). See the charging device adapted to your charged device for its specifications. I could not find reliable figures for the losses when charging with usb, plus it depends on quite some factors, so let's assume something like 15%.

Charging an iPhone with USB 2.0 would take : 
(1810/500)*1.15 = 4.16h = ~4h10min, let's say ""around 4 hours"".

with usb 3.0, it would be a little more than half that time (900mA  500mA) : 
(1810/900)*1.15 = 2.31h = ~2h20min

So, yeah. Basically, divide the capacity by the current of the charger, add some, and you have an estimation.

Be careful though that the higher the current of the charger is not necessarily the better, depending on the battery and the electronics monitoring the charge, too high a current will damage it (very high will cause it to burn/explode).",1484752520

Edit: I looked it up. It's not really a ground it's a common node. The potentiometer will have three leads, one will be at 0 volts, one will be at Vcc, and the last conductor will be at some voltage in between.

That last one is the position encoder and the computer turns that voltage into a corresponding throttle value, I guess telling the fuel injector hire much fuel to send and the has sensor what emissions you anticipate.

The way the potentiometer works is through voltage dividing. Think of the pot as a long series of 1 ohm resistors, let's say 100. If I put 5 volts across the resistors, and I take a volt meter and touch the last resistor, I'll get 5 volts. Of I touch the 50th resistor, there will be 2.5v. the current going through the resistors is 5v/100ohm or 5 mA. The drop across 50 resistors is 50 ohm x 5mA = 2.5 V

Because the physical earth can be very conductive, and because there are grounding electrodes installed in most electrical systems to connect them to the earth, current can use the ground as a path to get back to its source. The ground prong on plugs serves a completely different purpose though, it's there to connect the casing of the equipment being powered to the neutral at the service via a low resistance path called the *equipment grounding conductor* (so called because it is also bonded to the earth at this point), which provides a highly conductive path for fault current to flow in the event of, for example, a live wire accidentally touching the metal housing of an electric heater.

A 100W light bulb uses 100W of power at any given moment. Measure the voltage and the current at any given moment, and you'll calculate 100W, generally.

Power used over a span of time is called energy, usually measured in watt hours (Wh) or kilowatt hours (kWh), like what the electric utility bills you for. So if you leave that 100W light bulb on all day, the energy used 2.4 kWh.

If the maximum power consumption is 29 Watts, it doesn't make sense to say 
""29 Watts of power per month"". It would be 29 Watts a second, a minute, a day, a week, doesn't matter 29W is 29W any time you measure it. Do you have a data sheet or something for the wireless fence?  

For the sake of your battery needs, let's say they just worded it poorly and the maximum power consumption is 29 Watts. And you want to run it for 2 days (48 hr).

Does earth even have the same potential in all places?

Imagine I stand barefoot in moist soil. I imagine my body will have the same potential as earth. If I step onto a huge block of styrofoam, I imagine I keep the same potential unless I do something else. If I then touch a 100'000 V DC power line, I imagine my body would get a 100'000 V potential (compared to ground) as well? Wouldn't that also mean that there has to be some amount of current going from the line to me, causing this change in potential? And if I then step on the ground, would I not notice this, or would it be like a small static electric shock? Is the reason earth works well just that it's such a huge pool of charge that it can keep a current going for some while, and then simply makes sure charges even out more or less over time if you start getting small potential changes for different pieces of earth?",1486327758

Another common method of creating a better earth for a system is one seen here in Australia in particularly marshy areas like Port Botany etc where a large earthed cage is buried and then multiple earthing paths given to the electrical system. This works due to the fact that if the moisture on/around the cage is lower in one area and greater in another the multiple paths given by the cage compensate, by being a bigger (think physically) conductor that's deeper/covered/surrounded by more earth to give a better return path for any errant currents the Earth system is attempting to ground.",1486329535

590,Beefpadthai,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,Thank you so much! Are these generators powered by nuclear or coal?,1565625901
591,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The vast, overwhelming majority of energies generated on to the grid are consumed at the same time.  Only a very small amount is stored, usually to help resolve a highly localized power quality issue (for example: sagging voltage during peak utilization) or to provide a short term power supply to allow for alternative generating sources to be brought online (minutes).  

These applications for batteries are great for correcting transient / short term issues in power quality and have situationally attractive economic use cases.  

Long duration energy storage and supply, however, remains the realm of specialty application and rarely pencils out in terms of cost if a traditional redundancy option (emergency diesel generators, a separate redundant supply line, etc) is available instead. 

Finally, a hazard inherent to all energy storage systems, is the danger posed by the uncontrolled release of that stored energy.   A large utility grade storage lithium battery can fail, just like any battery.   With traditional power delivery systems, we can open a few switches and de-energize the line to isolate the failed section if protection systems fail.  With a failed battery, that may not be an option.  Also lithium can violently react with water (firefighters).  It’s a problem that is still being explored for reasonable solutions that don’t result in undue public safety.  

Finally, an example, for getting an idea of size and cost. 

Let’s say you want to have long term battery redundancy for one house and those batteries need to be able to supply energies for a 12h period every day.  The average US home uses about 1000 kWh per month or 33 kWh per day, 1.4 kWh per hour.  So we’re saying for half of that day the battery needs to operate, so it’ll need minimally a 16.5 kWh discharge capacity.  In reality, it would also need to be able to supply enough energy to operate multiple high usage equipments and have a higher kW demand availability but we’re using this as an analogy for utility grade storage where load diversity flattens out the utilization so we’ll ignore that real-world factor and just say it needs to have 16.5 kWh.  Home lithium battery systems with all the stuff you need to hook up and transform the energy into a usable form costs about $650 to 800 per kWh, and we want to be able to supply an average of 16.5 kWh per day so $700 * 16.5 = $11,550.  Size footprint is approximately 0.5 to 1 cubic meter.  So to do a battery backup system for a single house costs about $10,000 and takes up half a meter of physical space to cover you for half of an average day of usage.  Multiply that out for a modest sized town of 50,000 people now for 500 million dollars, and 25,000 cubic meters of volume (about 370 standard shipping containers / semi truck trailers).  And that’s enough storage to cover 825 MWh, again, about half a day for a modest town of 50,000 people’s residences (businesses and public buildings nonwithstanding). 

Let’s be generous and say it costs half as much to do it at scale vs single homeowner, so $5000 per household startup cash for the whole operation.  That’s still some very real money for an already provided service.  Also, those batteries won’t last forever, they’ll need to be serviced again after about 500 charge / discharge cycles, so even if we completely converted over to renewables and batteries we’d be changing every battery on the system every 2 to 4 years.  The cash burn rate would be incredible to operate such a system.  If utilities attempted to impose such costs on consumers they would riot over the expenses. 

That’s why you see only token efforts at utility grade storage (with regards to batteries).   It’s just still way too expensive. It’s a specialty solution for specialty problems at specialty locations.  Costs would need to significantly drop before its viable for widespread adoption.  

I hope this has helped give you some perspective on battery based storage systems for utility energy supplies.  It’s exciting to think about what we could do with better and cheaper energy storage systems, but the technology and costs aren’t there yet.",1565626983

The big coal and nuclear plants take a long time to start up, so they provide a base level of power, while generators can be switched on and off fairly quickly as per demand so they fill the fluctuating demand power.

Financially, the way it works is generation plant owners will look to generate as much as possible and be paid based on the meter measurements of what they output to the grid. Quite often they'll have contracts where they still get paid something if the demand is low and they're given the command to switch off, sometimes they'll have other elements like voltage regulation or reactive compensation that the grid may call for. Bigger plants like coal and nuclear will have a contract tailored more to their slow demand response, likely simpler with set demands and rates.

596,The_RealKeyserSoze,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"\-Electricity is just a convenient form of energy thats easy to convert into other forms. You can get energy from electricity because it takes energy to make the electrons move. Think of electricity like a pipe with water, you could use the energy of that water flowing to spin a wheel and get circular motion. This is basically how electricity spins a motor, except instead of directly hitting it it uses magnetic fields, but the outcome is the same. If you want heat you can run electricity through a resistor where the electrons flow is slowed down. The energy of the electrons flowing can't disappear since we can't destroy energy so instead it has to be converted into something, heat.

\-Most appliances are just moving things around so they use motors for motion or resistors to get heat. Dishwasher pumps hot water around, stove heats up with a resisting coil, water pump uses a motor to spin a wheel to push water, refrigerator uses a motor to compress refrigerant forcing out heat and another motor to pump it around (Air conditioner works the same way) then motors on fans send air over it to be cooled. 

\-Light bulbs work because the resistance creates heat and once the wire in the bulb gets hot enough its starts emitting visible light. This is actually how quantum physics was discovered. Basically all objects emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation (light) and the hotter the object is the higher the energy of the EM radiation emitted. So right now your body is emitting infrared light that you can't see but a thermal camera can, if you heated up to the temperature of a light bulb you'd start emitting visible light, further still and you'd produce UV, X-ray, and so on.",1565731415

622,taomark,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"To answer your question, yes. AC vs DC doesn't matter, current is current. But here is some more information if you're curious:

The two primary considerations for choosing a conductor are heat (from current as well as environment) and the rating of the insulation. 

Current passing through a conductor creates heat (AC or DC, doesn't matter; current is current). The bigger the wire, the more current it can handle before it gets too hot. Also, the surrounding environment of the conductor determines how well it can dissipate heat, so this is also taken into consideration. A conductor packed tightly with a bunch of other conductors inside of conduit up on a hot roof will have a different ampacity rating than a conductor by itself in free air, like in an overhead line.

The rating of the insulation can also affect heat dissipation, because that extra heat needs to get through the insulation in order to dissipate. Additionally, an insulation type will be rated for a certain maximum voltage. The reason for this is obvious, the higher the voltage, the more resistance it's able to overcome. A thin layer of insulation might prevent a low voltage from getting through it, but if the voltage is high enough, then it's possible to get through.

Also, the insulation will be rated for certain environments (direct UV exposure on a roof, completely soaked in water, directly buried in the ground, exposed to oils and solvents, etc.), so that is another consideration. The whole idea is that you want to make sure the insulation will always be able to do its job. If it gets brittle from UV exposure, or melts from high heat, or gets scratched up by rocks, or dissolves from some chemical, then it might not be able to do its job.

TL;DR  you need to pick a wire size that will prevent the wire from overheating (which can damage the wire, damage the insulation, start a fire, etc.), and this is based on the amount of current, the insulation type, and the environment. And you need to pick an insulation type that won't get compromised, and this is based on exposure to certain environmental conditions, and the expected voltage.",1566317131
623,Livintheslolife,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"This depends largely upon what the application of the current is. If the power is located at a power distribution center and must travel a long distance before being used, AC is better due to the fact that the voltage can be easily stepped up or down using a transformer (requires AC current to produce a changing magnetic field). This allows the amount of current needed to travel along long distance lines and therefore the power loss to be less. This is why high tension wires have voltages on the range of tens to hundreds of kilovolts. AC is also useful if you are trying to power a motor due to the fact that most motors run off of AC. If the power coming from the wall was DC, then whenever you wanted to power a blender or other device with a motor you would need to first convert to DC. DC is beneficial when you are trying to power other devices such as cell phones or TV's which require a DC input. These devices have rectifiers attached to the plug or in the power cord (think of a power brick for a laptop) which convert from AC to DC. Overall, in my opinion, I think AC is better than DC just due to the fact that more power can be transmitted with smaller cables and when DC is required it is not very difficult to convert from AC to DC where is it  more complicated to convert the other direction. 

Here's a link to an article that goes a little more in depth https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/alternating-current-ac-vs-direct-current-dc ",1487826724

627,tau-lepton,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"You nailed it

Wh is a unit of energy (think of an elevated large bucket full of 300 gallons of water, potentially energy).   Power (units of watts) is the rate of energy being used over time, the water leaving the bucket; potentially turning a very tiny generator, outputting one watt :).  If it empties the bucket in one hour then 300 Wh of energy is delivered.

Or in your example, a 300 watt (power) solar panel exposed to full sun for 1 hour would produce 300 Wh of energy. Possibly used to fill a bucket with water, or charging a 300 Wh battery to full capacity (ignoring losses).

A good trick to make sure you have the units correct is to include them in the calculation
So that you can carry them along, AKA dimensional analysis.

So your perfectly correct:

&gt;1,840/365

Becomes:

1,840 (hours/year)/365 (days/year)

628,OneRingOfBenzene,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt; 5.04 hours average per day exposure to direct sunlight in order to generate the expected yearly capacity ?

Almost- it would be a theoretical 5.04 hours per day of full generation to reach that average annual *generation*. 12.5 MW *is* the capacity- the term ""capacity"" simply means the maximum rated output of a generator.

The key here is that no generator is producing it's maximum rated output during all hours of all days of a year. A solar panel is not producing energy at night, and not producing full output unless very strong sunlight is present. The capacity factor of a generator is the is the average output of the plant divided by the maximum output of the plant, and is helpful to calculate.

If the plant produces 23 GWh in a year, then on average it is producing 2.63 MW of power through the course of the year. Divided by the maximum output of the plant - 12.5 MW - we can see it has a capacity factor of 21%. This means accounting for all downtime, and all hours where it does not have full sunlight, you can expect it to generate 21% of it's capacity.

The [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_6_07_b) reports that the average capacity factor of a PV system in the US was 25.8% in 2015.

Electricity doesn't normally flow in between non-conductive surfaces (i.e. walls) and normal household services do not generate strong EMF or magnetic fields. In order to get ""shocked"" the electricity would have to travel through a conductive pathway and into your body.

That being said, there are several instances where the voltage coming into the panel could surge (loose connection at the taps or lugs for example). This could affect your receptacles by giving inconsistent voltage and could potentially be the source of the ""popping"" sounds you hear (could be arc'ing on a loose connection), although it wouldn't cause any electricity to ""leak"" or anything like that.

Regardless, your first course of action should be to call a licensed electrician (or tell your landlord). Loose connections/potential arc'ing is one of the highest causes for electrical fires in homes.",1488221977
645,hmbemis,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt; So I shouldn't be worried if feeds 220v directly into the machine made for 120v?

In this case you should think of this like two totally separate machines...

Machine #1 converts input (120VAC) to output (12VDC)

Machine #2 converts input (12VDC) to sound

So in this case what I'm suggesting is that you replace Machine #1 (the adapter) with one that has an input range that matches your local electricity--most switching transformers have a 100-250VAC 50-60Hz input range, so it won't be hard to find--and also matches the output you need (12VDC at least 1.5A).

&gt;If I find a plug that works with 220v and outputs 12DC and 1.5, AND a barrel jack, it should work?

It will absolutely work.  If there's any sort of an electronics shop you can visit they will have no problem setting you up with this.  If you have access to Amazon or other online ordering you should be able to find something that matches too.  

For measuring the barrel you have a couple of options--if you have a caliper you can measure it directly, otherwise you can try to press it into something like paper and trace it out, then measure it.

You might also find the barrel specs if you look online for that adapter or keyboard (Japanese manufacturers are pretty good about supplying service and replacement info).

You could probably even run this keyboard off a 12V battery for quite a while.  I had a friend who used to do that while busking, he'd set a small car battery down under the keyboard on the sidewalk and could play for hours.",1488223788

It is possible, however, that the drop may have been poorly wired too. 

I would have an electrician test your connections and run volt meters where you're having issues. 

If I may ask, how old is the house? Are you running breakers or fuses? If they are fuses you should look to see if the electrical is running knob and tube connections.

Stray voltage can happen, but not in the way you think it might. Electricity cannot flow past or through walls, typically and would only happen in *very* rare circumstances. Like paper thin walls. Even then I doubt it would as it would also need a path to ground to flow.

&gt;Cooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This gap to excitations leads to superconductivity, since small excitations, such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.[7] The gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.

649,vivamario,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I'm by no means a master of electricity, and this is very simplified and  takes a lot of assumptions, like no resistance in your wiring, and your two batteries have the same capacitance.

The main fundamental relationship in electricity is:
Voltage = Current * Resistance

If you were to just hook a wire up between the two (assuming the 1.5V battery is rechargeable), there is virtually no resistance so you're going to have an insane amount of current. Everything is going to get hot and might explode. The wires would read 9V for a second and then explode.

Say you add a resistor to get the current to 1 amp, which is the current for batteries to recharge:

9V = 1A * Resistance,
Resistance =9 Ohms

So you hook up a 9 Ohm resistor, the battery will charge, but it won't stop at 1.5V, it will want to keep going and can again explode. The wires will read 9V - 7.5V and then the battery will explode.

Ok say you then hook up a transistor, which uses diodes to control the flow of current, that switches the circuit off when the battery is charged, then your battery will no longer explode.

It might be easier to think of electricity in terms of water. Voltage is your pressure, current is your volumetric flow rate, and resistance is your friction loss. If you measure the pressure between a 300-psi pipe and the atmosphere, its 300-psi, now you hook up a tank the same size and let the water flow through, it will eventually become that both tanks are at 150-psi. When you first start, the pressure between the two tanks will be 300-psi, when you finish the pressure between the two tanks will be 0-psi, and the pressure between the tank system and the atmosphere will be 150-psi.

Voltage is the same. The voltage along a wire is zero because they are nicely evened out. If you add some resistance between the wires, there will now be a small voltage difference, you add a lot of resistance, and there will be a big voltage difference.",1488291607

9V Alkaline batteries have a pretty high internal resistance of around 2-5 ohms, an AA NiMH is usually around 0.1 ohms. So most of the voltage difference will be across the internal resistance on the 9V, the wire will sit somewhere around 1.3-1.5V while the charge is flowing, with an initial current of around 1.5A.

The ballast is there to limit the current and is just a coil. It is used because there is negative differential resistance across the lamp, as it is an arc across a gas filled tube, unlike an incandescent lamp which uses a filament.

The problem is more than likely the starter, which is virtually a high frequency capacitor which ignites the gas. when they are faulty they can interfere with frequency dependent items like radios etc.

common 1 and common 2 that you talk about is the same active source, the power just switches between 1 leg or the other leg depending on what position the switch is in. there is no ""2 separate active wires"" running along side each other. 
A capacitor consists of 2 parallel conductors of opposite charges, there is no capacitance in 2 way switching. The only thing you get from a wire carrying current is a magnetic field, Hence how a transformer works.

The tube flickers due to ""LACK OF"" capacitance to ignite the gas, the voltage isn't high enough to ignite the gas. So your theory of the wires having capacitance is pure bullshit as they flicker because the starter (capacitor) is faulty.",1488873028
672,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Modern ballasts are electronic switch mode power supplies. The one you describe is an older magnetic type. They use a starter (in some desk lamps just a plain switch) which [opens and closes this circuit](http://www.siongboon.com/projects/2010-08-22%20electronic%20ballast/magnetic_ballast_schematic.png). This causes current to flow in the loop when it closes. [Here is a complete explanation.](http://www.edisontechcenter.org/Fluorescent.html) The capacitor in magnetic ballasts is not part of the starting. It is to reduce arcing on the starter contacts so they don't wear out too fast.

I don't know whether OP has a classical magnetic ballast or a modern electronic one. I suspected it was a modern electronic type, because of the flickering in the off state. If you look at the diagram I showed, [another one here, also shown in the off state](http://www.lightwiring.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2-way-powered-switch-schematic-wiring-diagram-590x238.jpg), the two wires are run together between the switches. They are typically run as ROMEX, so they are close together over many feet. This **forms a capacitor in series with the lamp** when the switches are in the off state. When they are on they bypass this. 

With electronic ballasts, [here is one of many diagrams](https://i0.wp.com/bestengineeringprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/circuit-diagram-of-electronics-blast-fro-tubelight.jpg), there is a rectifier and filter capacitor that converts the AC line to DC of about (line X 1.4 volts). For a 120 system this is ~160VDC. For a 230VAC system this is ~320VDC. They chop that at ~25-200KHz. This allows them to use smaller and cheaper components, than what would be needed at line frequencies of 50-60Hz.  It also eliminates the annoying 50-60Hz blink rate of direct line operation. You will not see blinking at even 25KHz, let alone 200KHz.

So when the two-way switch is off, some small amount of line current flows capacitively, from wire 1 to 2. This can get rectified and charge the filter cap. The DC voltage can build up until it is enough to start the lamp. BUT it cannot sustain the necessary current (the wire capacitance is too small to carry enough to keep it on). So the lamp flashes briefly and goes out. Then repeats.

By the way, I am an electrical engineer. I have designed many, many switch mode power supplies. 

Edit: after looking online I found an [electrician who did the actual experiments](http://www.electriciantalk.com/f2/induced-voltage-5206/) to show that a low level current will flow between adjacent wires. Quote from one of the posters on the linked forum:

&gt;It's not really a magnetic inductive effect if no load is present. It is a capacitive effect. If you know how a capacitor is constructed, you will understand it a little more. Two conductors separated by an insulator. Energy can be exchanged across the insulator without any electricity flowing directly between the two. The capacitance between the insulated wires causes the voltage of the un-connected wire to rise above the surrounding potential.",1488880235

Earth grounds are irrelevant.

That connection from bus bar to underground water pipe must be where that pipe enters a building.  And no where else. Pipes (water, gas, etc) inside a building must not be used for a safety ground.  And that is the topic - safety ground. Not earth ground.

Code is clear about this.  Third prong in a receptacle must only connect back to a main breaker box bus bar.   Connecting any receptacle safety ground to an earth ground electrode is a code violation.  Another example of why safety grounds and earth grounds are completely different.

Never ground electric to a pipe.  Any pipe.  Those electric currents must connect back to the breaker box only on wires intended (designed) to carry that current.

Once upon a time (ie 1944), water pipes were acceptable as an earth ground (and not as a safety or equipment ground).  That changed decades ago.

[This battery](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1403151-REG/core_swx_pb_edge_powerbase_edge_v_mount_battery.html) has a regulated output of 8.4V and max continuous draw of 8A. 

I'm gonna assume the dummy battery doesn't have voltage regulation but you can test this with a variable power supply and a voltmeter across the contacts of the dummy battery.

So assuming the V-Mount battery is designed for the camera, it looks like the camera is okay with an input voltage between about 7 and 8.5V, and has a max power draw less than or equal to 8.4V x 8A = 67.2W. Again you can measure this with an ammeter in series. 67W seems like a lot for a camera though.

So the camera should be ok with the 8V output from the gymbal, BUT if the camera is trying to draw more current than the voltage regulator in the gymbal is designed for you could damage it. The max draw (related to internal resistance) of the cells in the gymbal may also come into play, where attempting to overdraw will result in a voltage drop and possibly damage to the cells.

When you release the connection the magnetic field collapses faster than it built up and the resultant high rate of change of the field can cause hundreds of volts to occur on the primary side. As evidenced by the sparking as you pull back the wire. lets say you get 400V flyback spike. A typical coil flyback. The 17:1 ratio steps up the secondary to 6700Volts.

729,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"First, how many HP VFD do you want to power. Second, VFD DC feeds are a minimum of 160VDC, and the higher power ones are more like 400VDC, up to 1200VDC on the 100HP ones. So you would have to have a solar array set up for that much voltage, and have it regulated to the VFD DC supply. The direct solar will be all over the place and some circuits don't like it if they are run at too *LOW* a voltage, as well as too high a voltage.

DC over 32 volts get dangerous in a hurry. The standard switched, fuses, breakers, relays, and contactors MUST be rated for DC operation at those voltages.

Otherwise be careful in the wiring. Anything above 32 volts and especially at 100VDC and beyond requires electrical components, like switches, circuit breakers, and connectors that are rated for DC service. DO NOT use ordinary parts that were just made for 120 VAC.

Specifically, YOU CANNOT USE the electrical devices that are normally used for AC systems. Like Switches, connectors, circuit breakers, fuses and the like. They make specially designed ones for HVDC. And HVDC includes anything much over 48 VDC. Basically the problem with DC is that the current is continuous. AC current crosses zero twice per cycle. So the arc that forms when a switch or fuse opens tends to sustain on DC. In AC, the zero crossing allows the arc to cool enough to stop before the next alternation.

I called an electrician eventually. Honestly I just wanted to went about my worries a little here, I knew I'd have to call an electrician either way. He found that the master breaker (hopefully the right word here) wire was fried, like really badly burnt. I don't have access to it (didn't really know where it was, it was in the hallway outside) and he fixed it, though he advised me to get new breakers set in place. Although he fixed it I'm still really hesitant to plug in my laptop since I don't have an answer to the ticking yet. 

Could a burnt wire cause such an issue? A ticking of electricity (as in electricity switching between being available and not being available) seems kinda difficult to pinpoint. 

Also the breakers weren't tripping at all. I just didn't know the proper word for the ticking (still not a proper word, but I'll go with that for now, maybe flickering would be better) and I also didn't know what a breaker trip is. Sorry for the confusion. So the real issue was that my access to electricity was rapidly changing (that's what I call ticking) which honestly sounds really dangerous and I'm surprised nothing worse happened. 

I'm just worried that the burnt wire wasn't the cause but rather the effect of the ticking.... If I plug in the laptop now and it ticks again could it fry the wire again?

736,system37,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Good question. Capacitors and inductors, for being simply constructed devices, can be complex in analysis, especially when talking about AC circuits. 

Simply put, both devices oppose changes across them.  Capacitors generally try and oppose changes in voltage across their terminals.  Inductors try to oppose changes in current flow. 

Capacitors are often used in DC circuits to keep voltage constant if a voltage source may fluctuate. The first application that comes to mind here the big capacitors that car stereo people will sometimes install between positive and ground by the amp that they use for their subwoofers.  In this application, when the amp pulls a large amount of current and the supply voltage begins to sag, the capacitor will discharge itself to try and keep voltage constant. In linear power supplies, capacitors are often used like this to filter out the ""ripple"" of AC being rectified into DC. 

A common application of inductors are fluorescent lights.  Generally these are powered by house current, which is AC. A fluorescent light tube is filled with mercury vapor, which, once its heated up, will generally look very low in resistance to the power supply.  That would result in a ton of current flowing through the tube. To limit the current flow, an inductor is placed in series with the lamp. It will tend to limit the current flow.  In this application, they're referred to colloquially as ""ballasts"" because they function to sort of weigh down the circuit enough that current doesn't flow like crazy.  You could do the same thing with a resistor in series with the lamp, but now you have wasted energy in the form of heat that the resistor makes when current flows through it.  An inductor is a less wasteful way of achieving the same goal. 

These are both relatively simple uses of these devices.  Where inductors and capacitors get really complicated is when they're used in AC circuits for some of their other characteristics, like phase shifting voltage or current. They are often used in filtering circuits because, based on their values, they will respond differently to different frequencies of AC.  

So for your analogy, think of an inductor as a resistor that only works on AC? That's obviously an oversimplification, as you'll find out, but that's probably as good a start as any. 

I hope that helps a little?  I'm not an EE, so if you're looking for a more mathematical explanation, someone else will need to chime in. ",1490914722
737,singlerider,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The best (water) analogy I've come across for an inductor is to imagine an old fashioned waterwheel, placed into a tidal stream that reverses its direction (ie AC as an inductor doesn't really oppose current flow for DC - well, it does, but doesn't create a reactance.)

Consider the stream and wheel at rest to begin with. Once the water starts to flow in one direction there is pressure (voltage) and water flow (current) going that way. However, the wheel has inertia and does not start to spin immediately - it opposes the change. Eventually the inertia is overcome, and the wheel spins up to speed. Once the tide stops going in that direction and reverses (changes its polarity) the wheel will continue to spin, because it has momentum - again, opposing the change.

A better analogy is a mechanical one, where we say the inductor is like a spring (particularly pleasing because a spring is a coil of wire, and an inductor is also a coil of wire) - if you try and stretch a spring it will try and contract, if you try to compress a spring it will try and extend. What this means electrically is that if you try and increase current flow through an inductor it will try and oppose this and if you try to remove current flow it will try to maintain it.

An example of both of these in action is a magnetic ballast for a fluorescent lamp - initially on start up mains voltage is not enough to strike the tube, but the starter interrupts the current flow, attempting to take it away from the inductor. The energy stored in the magnetic field is converted back into electricity as the field collapses, causing a massive voltage surge that strikes the tube. One the tube is lit, as it is a negative differential resistance device, left to its own devices it would allow current flow to spiral out of control, but now the ballast opposes the increases and prevents it from running away.

This is what happens when you switch off an inductor - it creates a surge in opposition to the change causing it, known as a back emf or counter emf and defined in Lenz's Law.

A capacitor, switched off, will slowly discharge, which is why you will often see indicator lights on equipment stay on for a couple of seconds after unplugging them, as the capacitor is still supplying electricity for a brief time.

A capacitor does not store voltage and an inductor does not store current, they both store energy. The formulas for how much are:

W = 1/2CV^2 where W is energy, C is capacitance and V is voltage.

W = 1/2LI^2 where L is inductance and I is current.

If you charged a capacitor it would hold onto that charge, and could even be used in place of a battery, say for instance in a UPS system. It would not discharge (well, it might gradually over time, but let's ignore that) unless connected to a load or unless the plates were shorted out.

If you charged an inductor, it would discharge almost immediately once the supply was removed.

In terms of what they do - an inductor is variously called choke, ballast, solenoid, all sorts, but essentially all these things are just coils. They can be used to create relays, transformers, fault protection, high frequency filters, discharge devices and many other things. A capacitor can be used to filter low frequencies, smooth out waveforms, correct power factor, act as a supply in its own right amongst other things. 

Combining the two together can create filter circuits for specific frequencies, create oscillator circuits for electronics etc - open up pretty much any consumer electronics and you'll find a bunch of both used for all kinds of things

While being true, is different if you short the inductor. In fact in superconductive magnets, that is exactly what they do. They connect the magnet coil to a constant current power supply, adjust the current to the desired magnetic field, short the coil out, then remove the supply. The current continues on indefinitely as long as the magnet coil is kept below the critical temperature. No further need of a power supply to keep the magnet ""alive"". In this case the energy stored is not the objective. It is the resulting magnetic field that is created. Like for [MRI Magnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnet).

A common use of energy storage in inductors is in [switched mode power supplies](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/4087). In this case they typically use BOTH inductive and capacitive energy storage. Look down to the section: SMPS Topologies and Conversion Theory. By different arrangements you can design for different uses of those energy storage/load uses.

&gt;As mentioned in the previous section, SMPSs can convert a DC input voltage into a different DC output voltage, depending on the circuit topology. While there are numerous SMPS topologies used in the engineering world, three are fundamental and seen most often. These topologies (seen in Figure 2) are classified according to their conversion function: step-down (buck), step-up (boost), and step-up/down (buck-boost or inverter). 

In all three, the inductor does not store energy for longer than microseconds, before it is dumped into a capacitor for longer time storage.  Typically inductors are never used beyond microsecond storage, because even though shorting them will cause them to hold their energy, they cannot do it for very long. This is because of I^2 * R losses. Since current is actually flowing in the wire of the coil, it is losing energy at a high rate. So whenever inductors are used to store energy, they typically do not do so for more than a few microseconds. Otherwise the storage efficiency would be very poor. In a capacitor, as long as you do not load it and the insulation resistance is very high, the energy can be stored for months or even years with a well designed capacitor. The only way to do that with inductors is with superconductive inductors. But since they have a high refrigeration need, are not practical.",1491268227

My case 120VAC. The heater acts as a ballast to limit the current into the arc. You can adjust the power by using lower wattage heaters or paralleling more to raise the limit.

It seems as if you were never taught how to use units. This lack of basic understanding concerns me because of the nature of what you are trying to attempt—how far are you in your education? You must understand basic concepts like current and voltage at least before you mess with this stuff. Do you understand power supplies? Do you appreciate that electricity is dangerous?

Regardless I will help you with your understanding, because your capacitor probably won't do harm anyway lol.

The next few paragraphs probably won't click right away, but when you get to learning units in a few days, months, years, or whenever, I really hope you reread this post and see that I wasn't talking out of my ass ;) You can use it to get a headstart in physics. units are something **everyone** gets wrong the first time they study physics, and they have to be corrected multiple times by a teacher before it really sinks in. Nonetheless they are super basic once you get your head around them once, so I really hope this helps.

&gt; What is the F/m supposed to mean? Is it part of the equation? How do I use that in the calculations?

You know that when you ask how tall someone is, and they say ""2"", you can't really determine anything about said person's height. It needs a unit. For all you know they could be 2 m tall, 2 ft, 2 centimeters...

Like ""2 m"", the ""8.854 * 10^-12 F/m"" (you dropped the exponent!) is a **physical quantity**. It is not an equation. It has a magnitude, 8.854 * 10^-12, and a **dimension** [capacitance/distance]. I chose the SI units Farads/Meter (written as F/m) to help express the sizes of these dimensions.

Physical quantities have to match the dimensions of the property they are expressing. When you say that you are 2 m tall (dimension: [distance]), you are matching dimensions. When you talk about your rate of growth you are discussing a speed with dimension [distance/time], e.g. m/s, miles per hour, or km/h. Notice that you can divide and multiply units just as you can magnitudes, to match the dimension you want. If you drove 1000 km [distance] in 3 years [time], you can calculate your speed to be 333.3 km/year. Again, you operate on both the magnitude and the units. Simply giving 333.3 as your speed is meaningless, and saying 333.3 km or 333.3 years is wrong.


Permittivity, like length or speed, is a **physical property**. It has dimensions capacitance/distance, and SI units Farads/meter.

The permittivity of free space, like the length of a pencil or the speed of a car, is a physical quantity, expressed with both a magnitude and units. I used **scientific notation** to express the physical quantity because it's very small, which makes it impractical to keep writing out in full, but know that it's equal to about 0.000000000009 F/m.

Your dielectric is paper, not free space, so you multiply by a **relative permittivity** of 3. It just scales the permittivity of free space, so it has no dimension. It is a known quantity by people who work with it a lot, so you only have to remember the scaling factor when you're dealing with the material. 3 for paper is simpler than ""2.8 * 10^-11 F/m for paper"".

To calculate the capacitance of a capacitor using the equation in my above reply, I wanted you to ensure you weren't making a mistake by taking care of your units. You could have obtained the permittivity in non SI units for example, or scaled by a prefix or whatever, so that you'd have for example 8.854 * 10^-14"" if you found it with units F/cm.

You need units for A and d as well. Let's assume you used the SI units of area and distance like they should have on wikipedia, i.e. m and m^2.

To check that the physical quantities you substitute into the equation C = epsilon * A/d make sense, you can do some **dimensional analysis**. Check that the units on each side of the equation make sense when you substitute in SI units for each physical property:

[F] = [F/m]*[m^2]/[m]

= [F/m]*[m]

= [F]

thus we have farad equals farad, so it's consistent and the units are okay.

Now, try replying with the relevant **physical quantities** substituted into this equation. Cancel the units and check that you arrive at a capacitance with the correct units: Farads.

&gt;Its capacitance could be reached under any supply of power given enough time, right?

No, your understanding here is wrong: capacitance is a property of the capacitor itself, and is not a function of the state of the capacitor. Of course, there are non-idealities that make the previous statement false but you shouldn't consider them for now.",1491342798
749,anonymat,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Ok let me first say I'm not an electrician. But I do have a degree in electrical engineering technology and about a decade of working in power distribution and design. 

The risk of electrical fire from an unloaded outlet is minimal. Electricity becomes dangerous when a circuit is under too heavy of a load. Think of the TV trope of the father plugging all the Christmas lights into one power bar - what they don't show is the father has bypassed the safety features built in to these circuits; he's removed the fuse and replaced it with a nickel for instance. Then the circuit is able to pass more electricity than the wires allow - causing them to heat up significantly more than their designed for. This causes the insulation to melt, which in turn catches the wood in your wall to burn. 

So all this to say: if you haven't bypassed the circuit breakers or fuse panel in your home, and you've purchase CSA/UL certified power bars, you're perfectly safe to use them as described. 

As for your bed against the outlets - not a concern in any way. Unless you have lots of liquids or loose metal in your bed which could get lodged in the outlet. 

And your outlets are just worn. They can be changed by a local electrician for very cheap. Maybe less than 20$ per outlet. It's a worthwhile investment in my opinion, but it poses no immediate risk. As long as you leave the plug in the outlet fully. You can very gently spread the prongs on the plug to help keep it in place.

Weird that you are responsible for this issue in an apartment, usually complexes are very strict that they deal with and contract electrical issues, since a fault in one can cause issues to everyone (and cost them big).  Not to mention insurance wouldn't cover a complex where every renter is responsible for maintaining electricals.

First, I would make sure the landlord is made aware of this issue, and say you're concerned about a fire hazard(not just the inconveniences).  Any electrical fault is a fire hazard.  Depending on your situation, if that doesn't cover it, you need to speak with the electrician that installed the breaker about redoing the job.

756,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Watt-hour = Average consumed wattage (watts) * time (hour)

Watt = Voltage * Amperage

Meters typically measure watt-hour since its easiest to use for billing energy consumption, despite being a somewhat non-intuitive unit.  

------
Batteries' overall power delivery capacity are given (usually, at consumer level) in milli-amp-hours (mAh).

1 Milli-Amp-Hour = .001 Amp consumed for 1 hour


Example:
If your battery says that you have 5000 mAh that tells you that, regardless of voltage, you can consume .001 Amps for 5000 hours on that battery.  

If you consume .002 Amp, you get 2500 hours. 

If you consume .01 Amp, you get 500 hours.

If you consume 1 Amp, you get 5 hours.

If you consume 2.5 Amp, you get 2.5 hours.

Why milli-Amp-hours though?  Well, for most consumer electronic applications the devices utilize a pulsed power battery charger (in a phone for instance) which is not super dependent on voltage and allows for it to be a little variable on the battery side. Since the output voltage on a battery is non-linear it becomes difficult to accurately quantify Watt-hour from a battery perspective, especially at different charge levels.  

They can, however, hook a known constant current drawing device to the battery and measure how long it takes to effectively discharge.  Be aware that some batteries over-boast their nameplate milli-Amp-hours to include areas that most applications would consider a ""dead"" battery as all they have to draw is .001 A, a teensy tiny amount.  

If you are bothering to calculate expected discharge time for batteries, you should also be aware that that mAh rating is ideal, right when you buy it.  Depending on the battery type (lead-acid, NiCd, NiMh, Li-Ion, LiPo) you should expect that capacity to degrade with each discharge cycle.

How could you possibly not set up electricity in your home?  Do you think it’s free?  That this stuff just magically happens?",1570533726
763,ScottieLikesPi,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Hi there. 

So the meter you're looking to buy will rate the electrical flow using two methods, one actually tapping the line, the other not, but it will not affect your electrical devices, and I'll explain how. 

First, to read the power demand you need the equation P=i*V*pf, where P is power, i is current, V is voltage, and pf is power factor. 

To obtain the voltage, the meter is going to create what amounts to an open circuit (one that doesn't have a connection from line to neutral) that it can then compare to ground. It looks at the voltage and divides it into smaller bands to get a very good approximation. 

Suppose you use it in your home and you know it's 120V. It will measure somewhere between 110V and 130V, and then run a comparison. So the first would be ""is this voltage above 120V? If yes, 1, else 0"". So if we had, say, 119.32V, the meter would give a 0. Next it asks ""is this voltage above 115V?"" Yes, so our output is now 01. Rinse and repeat until you have about 8 digits for the output. That is the number it reads at that moment. 

Now onto current. Modern meters do not need to tap the line to read current like in the past. Instead they use current transformers, which take a voltage and scale it so the on board comparison chip can narrow down the exact current being used. It does this like the above example, only here the comparison is against only the windings of the transformer. The windings create losses, and the system already knows what those losses are. Compared against the voltage, the system now has a very close approximation of the current. 

Now, why does power factor matter? Your utility company cares a lot and so should you. Power factor is how efficient your device is, making use of all the energy available every time your AC cycles up and down. If your voltage and current no longer cycle in sync, the power isn't being consumed at peak efficiency. 

The reason this matters is because if you only took the peak voltage and peak current, it wouldn't tell you the actual power consumed. Since the meter is already measuring current and voltage on a moment by moment basis, it factors in the power factor automatically. 

So how does this device power itself? It will probably tap the line itself, but I wouldn't worry. The amount of power it needs is trivial, as its going to need around 5 volts to work. Even if it used more than .1 amps (which I doubt) that's only .5 watts, well within the acceptable noise range for this device to detect. 

So don't worry, your meter isn't going to adversely affect your equipment.

766,axeslinger666,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Hi there, just wanted to start by saying it's great that you are wanting to learn to build this. A great sub for things of this nature is r/diyelectronics, check it out too!

Here is a video I found where someone built a hand crank cellphone charger with a DC motor, you could start your process by watching it and learning the basic process of piecing an electronic project together from scratch. https://youtu.be/6xpFQGlhEOg

Note the voltage regulator they use, that is going to be the heart of the cellphone charging circuit. It will make sure that the voltage going to the charge port stays consistently around 5V.

For your specific idea, you may have to play around with different DC motors until you find one with the right gearing that will allow it to spin with wind force. In the video they used a low gear motor for hand cranking, so maybe try a high gear motor.

Another thing you should be looking into is availability of soldering equipment, and learning resources on how to solder. There are a ton of videos out there that should get you started. Soldering is an essential skill for playing around with electronics.

768,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Depending on the size of the proposed solar farm you may be looking at exclusively transmission lines.  If you are installing something below 1 MW or (less than a quarter/half acre) you likely can connect it to distribution.  Any larger and your local utility will probably prefer the solar array to be connected to transmission lines through a step-up transformer.  

Three phase lines will generally have at least 3 conductors in the air, most oftentimes more with 4 being typical in North America.  Check with your local utility for more information around the site you have in mind.  The particulars of where and of what kind / size of power assets are in a given area are usually not readily available information for security reasons unless you have a particular project in mind. ",1492152049
769,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Following up, 

The North American power grid (and most others for that matter) are divided into a few distinct segments:

Generation, connected to transmission.  Centralized (or mostly centralized) power generators for regional or municipal needs. 

Supply substations step up from generation to transmission voltages. 

Transmission is 34.5 to 500 kV lines and beyond.  Expect 34.5, 69, 115, 138kV sizes to be common in rural to semi-rural areas.  This portion of the grid is the equivalent to highways, moving large amounts of power around over tens to hundreds of miles.  (The transmission grid is typically redundant with two-way alternative feeding commonly available but not universal). 

Distribution substations step down from transmission to distribution voltages. 

Distribution is 4kV up to but typically not including 34.5 kV.  These are the most common power lines and are largely radial in nature.  (The distribution power grid in rural settings is typically a star topology, if you are familiar with network architectures). This, at your mentioned kVA would be what you would probably be connecting to. 

Distribution transformers step down voltage to consumption levels (120, 208, 240, 277, 480V is common and up to approximately 4kV is the cutoff.  

Consumers' meters are the last point on the utility.  From this point on it is the realm of electricians, the NEC code book, and consumers.  

----

100 kVA is pretty small peanuts production.  If you can work it out with your local utility, a ""net metering"" solution will probably be the most economical for deployment.  This would be basically you having a meter connected to the solar for counting your production credits.  If you consume power at this premises you would have another meter for consumption.  If you lose supply power at this location, the solar will isolate itself from the grid to protect workers and the public and your premises will lose power like everyone else. 

If, alternatively, you want to use this solar to provide backup / off grid power to a premises you will instead need to incorporate a manual or automatic source transfer setup.  This will be expensive.  (Think double or more over net metering).  Unless you have a reliability use case, this is usually not economical at current market prices.  This is reserved for persons who cannot afford to be offline on premises for more than a reasonable fraction of a day. 

If you want to backup your solar with batteries it will be even more expensive.  (Think double or more over source transfer setup). If you are not a hospital, data center, or something with extremely sensitive reliability needs the costs and fire-containment difficulties can make this very difficult to justify (not impossible though, and it's getting better!).  These setups are reserved for those who cannot afford to be offline for a few hours or less. 

----

Technology is changing and the utilities are evolving to meet these distributed generation requests but the costs are not trivial.  There's a massive amount of machinery and labor behind every household plug that is aimed at keeping power affordable and reliable.  I cannot really understate the complexity of the entire system from generator to meter.  Plus, without diving too far into the weeds, it was designed to flow only one direction, at least traditionally.  We can support some degree of distributed generation but we also have to balance worker and public safety against these distributed generation assets.  (Is this powerline actually dead???).  

TL:DR 
You'll probably be fine connecting your solar but you might have to manage expectations.  Utilities are trying to meet your needs as a consumer, fellow citizen, and customer.  Welcome to the cutting edge",1492161668
770,Ms_KnowItSome,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"You're talking about a 6 figure or more project and you're getting tripped up on the simplest of things. If you are in North America, not only should you be talking to the utilities in your search area, but to your regional transmission operator, PJM, NYISO, MISO, ERCOT, etc. That is the organization that actually handles the payment for generation and runs the transmission grid unless what you are planning to do is too small, which it might be, and then just the utility handles it. 

Either way, the New Business departments at the utilities will share their distribution and transmission maps with you and you can actually do this project like a real generation developer. This isn't a project you can search google for maps on. Transmission maps are considered national security sensitive information. 

Edit: Oh, and the 3 phase thing, which I didn't answer. Spinning generators (the kind like wind, hydro, nuclear, coal, oil are) are most efficient with a setup that creates 3 separate sine waves of AC power 120 degrees apart. For residential power, you take one of these phases and transform it to single phase 120/240v power. For commerical power you'll generally deliver 3 phases of power at whatever voltage is necessary which the customer will use for whatever purposes they need. 3 phase motors are much smoother starting than 1 phase motors, so they are favored in industrial settings.

It gets really deep real quick if you want to know how/why but just know that three phase transmission is pretty much the standard in north america. If you look at the towers and there are three conductors on there, it is most likely three phase. 
You would normally have to build a substation at the solar farm to connect to a high voltage system. ",1492177744

If they do, and your solar array is not heavily subsidized by govt. money your economics will probably not work out.  

Some of your comments, in general, suggest that additional research would do you a lot of good and I definitely agree with that sentiment.  You should carefully study the economics of this setup, especially if you are anticipating doing some sort of production automatic transfer scheme.  I have seen the twinkle go out of eyes on these projects when these items start being accounted for:

1) Solar panels do not produce their nameplate output very often.  Unless you live somewhere near the equator that is sunny and clear most of the time or in a high desert you should prepare for cloudy days, indirect winter lighting, shorter winter days, and general aging of the panels.  These panels produce less power over time, prepare for that.  Before you blow a ton of cash on this, ask other people who have done the setup what they think.  

2) Automatic or manual transfer setups can easily run in excess of $30k USD and may not necessarily be covered by govt. subsidization of solar deployments.  

3) If you need to have three phase power line built to your location you can assume it will cost at least $200,000 per mile to build if it's a flat hay field with existing single phase lines in place.  If you're in an urban, sub-urban environment, or difficult terrain double it or more.  This won't be subsidized by govt. programs either.  

4) Land use.  It's easy to forget but land is a limited and often taxed commodity.  You will be paying taxes for your land regardless, but with solar in place you have now used that land.  Make sure to include this in your economic analysis.  

Do some additional research before you get too pumped up about this.  Put the pencil to paper and make sure what you are planning on building makes sense.  It will take a very long time to recoup $50,000+ in costs at 100kW production.  

Have you considered filling the land with rare hardwoods and letting them grow instead?  It might be a better investment.  ",1492182835

So the 61% number doesn't sound horribly absurd, but it does seem rather high.  I say this because I work as an electrical designer, and we average about 85% efficiency, or an approximate waste of 15% from a pure electrical standpoint. 

Now, the problem here is that the 15% number I just quoted is only from the losses inherent in a system due to power factor. In electrical terms, your power factor determines how efficient you are. However, depending on how much power you're using overall, it might be more efficient to be less efficient. I'll give you an example.

Let's take two lightbulbs. One is an incandescent bulb, while the other is a compact fluorescent. Both are rated for the same light output, and both are the same color (temperature). The incandescent bulb is rated for 60W, while the compact fluorescent is rated at 13W.  The power factor of an incandescent bulb is 100%, meaning there are no losses in the system, while the compact fluorescent is around 90%. This means that the incandescent bulb will use only 60W of power, while the compact fluorescent will use 14.4W, with 1.4W wasted. 

Now, look at the bottom two numbers. Even though the compact fluorescent loses energy due to power factor, it is still requiring less power than the incandescent. 

So we're already moving in a good direction with lightbulbs, but your biggest power demand often comes from your air conditioner. This monster of a unit kicks on and off throughout the day, trying to cool the air so you're more comfortable. When a motor such as this starts, it begins in what's called the Locked Rotor state. When the motor begins to turn, it's fighting all the load at once, and has no momentum built up, and so it will draw up to six times its normal load when it first starts up. In fact, it takes long enough to get up to speed that we rate breakers for motors as the largest motor load at 125% plus any other motors on that circuit. 

So what can we do to combat this? Well, the best solution is to use solar panels in my opinion. Solar is getting cheaper by the day, and you're mostly drawing on it during daylight hours, which happens to be the hottest time of the day. This will help cut down on energy demand, which both saves money and keeps power plants from having to shut on and off to accommodate increased demand.  It won't fully offset all those units, but it can make a serious dent in the demand.

And the last point I'd like to make is in regards to insulation. Insulation is your best friend when it comes to saving household energy, along with heavy duty black-out curtains. These curtains help keep thermal energy from the sun out during the day, which helps keep your bill low. Many power companies will even offer rebates or even free instillation of insulation throughout the house, because it keeps them from having to bring new units online and it saves the customer money. It's a win-win. 

Good luck with your essay and I hope some of what I said helps!",1493073652
795,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"You can connect batteries in either parallel or series.   

When connecting in parallel your line voltage is going to be set by the battery in the group with the highest voltage.  In most design cases, batteries considered to be connected in parallel will have the same output voltage.  In the ideal case where voltages are matched and and each battery has the same internal impedance, each battery will contribute equal current.  The load (resistance) applied to these parallel batteries along with each battery's internal impedance will determine the current supplied.  In the case where each battery is identical, each battery will supply current inversely proportional to the total number of batteries (if you have two batteries, each will supply half of the demand current; if you have four batteries, each will supply one quarter of the demand current).  The primary motivation when paralleling batteries is usually to increase discharge time by splitting the load across many batteries that are hopefully more economical than one large battery.  

The second way to connect batteries is in series.  This is the most common arrangement found in consumer electronics with common battery sizes.  Connecting batteries in series boosts voltages up from the single battery level (1.5V for example in a AA type) to a more useful level (4x AA in series = 1.5Vx4=6volts). Many small electronic devices operate in the 3, 6, and 12V ranges which is achieved commonly by stacking battery cells in series.  When connecting batteries in series, their internal impedances also are connected in series.  The more batteries you connect in series, the less output current you will have available for high consumption devices.  This is partially why we have large heavy lead-acid batteries in our vehicles to start them instead of 8X AA batteries.  The other reason lies in the actual construction of the cells and the electrolyte in the battery itself.  Even if you made 8x AA batteries of the most premium money-is-no-object materials they likely would not have enough current delivering capacity to turn over an internal combustion engine, the form-factor of the battery is simply too small to deliver enough power to the starter.  (Note, some exceptions may exist on the very fringes of what humans can build but they would be effectively nonsensically expensive to use compared to a big lead acid battery).

800,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The short answer is yes, both the voltage (Volts) and the frequency (Hertz) are applied to the load (appliance, light, motor, heater, computer, etc). 

The energy (Watts) needed to drive or otherwise operate the load will determine the current (Amperes) flowing through the power cables.  

Generally, when one overloads a household circuit they are connecting too many things that are needing energy (Watts) to a wire that is too small to carry that much current (Amperes) without generating unsafe amounts of heat (BTUs) which can start a house fire (many BTUs).  

If your wire is too long (feet/meters) the energy (Watts) dissipated by the wire as heat (BTUs) because of all the current (Amperes) passing through it can result in too low of voltage (volts) to drive or operate the load (appliance, other).  

Your frequency (hertz) will usually not vary because of how strong the signal is coming from the power grid (many large generators).  If you are, however, powering your appliance by a small generator, such as one that runs on gasoline, the load (appliance, other) can be too much for the small generator to power and your frequency will begin to slip.

A phantom load is any device that consumes electricity when turned off but still plugged into an outlet. These electronic devices provide the modern-day conveniences we rely on, but they also waste energy and cost money.

http://www.takecontrolandsave.coop/documents/PhantomLoad.pdf

Your friends apple cable doesn't use any reactive power, especially if not plugged into anything. However the potential to power it is still there, it just needs to complete the circuit, i.e. The phone being plugged in. And has a very small amount of potential in the plug, like fractions of a volt that will dissipate when unplugged from the wall. 

However, say your friend unplugs his tv or computer when not in use, then yes, he's saving a bit of power. Since he's not keeping capacitors charged, the main source of reactive power aside from generation. And there for would take a slightly long period to turn on. 

Another user of phantom load is something that's on, but not being used, like a modem or a power strip. 

Kind of non-sequitur but if you're curious:

Power is generated in two forms:

Real power - what it takes to make coffee for example. 

Reactive power - is used on motors like a fridge. It's also used to bring stability to a transmission grid. And can draw more load to the appliance to help the motor spin up when refrigeration is needed to kick in. Same with an HVAC system in your house.

Active transformer load management programs are still a part of a modern utility's operations and maintenance program, probably more significantly in the last 20 years than ever.  The hazards and possible legal / financial liabilities related to an overloaded piece of equipment failing are a concern for system operators.  

A distribution transformer can regularly be overloaded to 150-200% of its nameplate rating for years but there is a temperature and loading level where they fail.  Operating these transformers at that level also shortens the life of that piece of equipment that otherwise would have no trouble operating for 50+ years.  

The real rub comes with modern Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) providing hourly or better reads from the meters.  This takes the historical methods of approximating transformer load levels based on diversity factors out of the picture and instead makes gathering data and identifying overloaded transformers an IT / database problem that is based on actual observed values.  

I do not doubt that in the 60s and 70s they just let equipment fail not because they didn't care but because they just didn't have the data.  In the modern developed country the legal liability framework, public intolerance of power outages, improvements in data availability, and better overall administration of the system has led to actively replacing these devices before they fail.  It is much cheaper to get a land owner to pay for a transformer upgrade due to observed load expansion before something fails instead of charging them for the repair and replacement costs of a failure.  Further, if you have previously identified the overload and notified them of the problem and they refuse to pay or cooperate with managing their load you can use that paper trail as a legal shield should the damaged equipment cause property damage or if it is decided to disconnect them until they comply.  

The OP is very much in a different situation than what is available in the developed world.  There is a lot of administrative development that extends well beyond simple power systems that needs to occur before the frequent system outages in his original comment can be reasonably expected to be mitigated.  

And yes, revenues from power sales fund all of these improvements.   If the power is off due to an overload it's very hard to make energy sales.   Then again, if there is 15 unapproved taps being taken off of a distribution transformer to unmetered delivery points which in turn will overload the transformer and cause it to fail eventually it is also very hard to make energy sales.

Just because you said something doesn't mean you did it correctly or that you were thorough. **For example, you never mentioned the WHOLE NEW AMP or your pedals in your original post!** You also haven't mentioned if you are getting sound out of the amplifier now, if it's dead, if it has a hum.... DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. These are functions of different parts of the circuit, and the effects created by their interactions gives us information about how the circuit is behaving and where the problem may be introduced. I am trying to think through the issue and eliminate obvious questions. The history you have given, while somewhat informative, has serious gaps and also did not solve the problem. We need to look at the problem wholistically to make sure we solve it correctly.

First question: What is the symptom? Eliminate avenues of possible error from there. Symptom: you are getting shocked. Why do people get shocked? A voltage differential between the person and the item touched. Most likely culprit: an energized guitar. What would cause a guitar to get energized? Guitars should be grounded (which is why you can touch the strings safely), so there is a voltage being sent to your guitar that should have been grounded, and we know it is referenced to earth ground since the computer is referenced to earth ground. Where are the possible sources of voltage? Your amp and your pedal, everything else is passive.

Find the spot where you have voltage that should not have it. Trace the node back until you find the point that is producing that incorrect voltage. My best guess at this stage is that you have a floating node in the power cable or battery for your pedal.

How severe is the shock? Is it wall voltage or the 9V power supply? If you don't know, you can check it with your multimeter between your strings and your computer case or another earth ground point. AC for wall voltage, DC for pedal voltage.

You can look up a lot of schematics by searching manufacturer's part numbers into Google. If you need instruction on how to use a multimeter, read a schematic, or even understand the basics of electricity, 20 minutes on Youtube will give you a good overview. 

Electricity flows through the path of lowest resistance, the shortest path to ground. Don't send current across your heart and you should be fine. It is tough to injure yourself doing this, ~~given you don't go into the power amplification section of your amp (second stage, big mosfets or tubes depending on what type you have).~~ Scratch that, just don't open the amp and give it to a professional if it is determined to be the cause.

I'm no electricity professional, but educated physicist. So I don't like ""voltage running"", since current is the quantity which can flow through the wire, requiring a voltage drop if there is resistance.

Tripping the [RCCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual-current_device) is not happening here because it monitors current in and current out, and no current goes missing. A voltage drop across socket-ground and a waper pipe does not equal a current flowing (normally nothing would connect those two, and the voltmeter used for measuring has so high resistance, mega ohms, that no current flows).

Getting a professional to verify the installation can never hurt, I just like to be able to perform an independent test verifying whether something works or not :)

A residual-current device (RCD), or residual-current circuit breaker (RCCB), is a device that instantly breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (miniature circuit breaker) is known as a RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection).

So for a 120 v to 12 v transition, there are 10 times more windings on the 120v side that the 12v side. The transformation is done by magnetic coupling between the two.

Current. The ampacity of your outlet is limited by the wire size, in your example #14 AWG for 15 amps. The wire size on the 12v volt side of the power supply is very small, since it only has to carry 2 amps. That wire will be it's limiting factor. It appears you understand Ohms Law Volts=Amps x Resistance. Stated differently, A=V/R. So the transformer will supply whatever amps you need as long as the impedance of your load (in relation to the 12 volts) doesn't go below 6 ohms (12 v / 6 ohms=2 amps).

Re-reading this, it seems awkward, so let's re-try. The output of any transformer is dependent on the impedance (or resistance to current flow) of the load. So the wattage it supplies is dependent on what you put into it. Any transformer can supply considerably more current than it is rated for, but only briefly until it's insulation breaks down and it self destructs.",1574265703

jfc no offense but the lack of basic electrics knowledge from questioners on this sub combined with the high voltage or power RF nature of the projects they seem invariably to be planning is frankly terrifying. But hey it's not my funeral.

On to the explanation.

* The electrical grid will supply an outlet with a fixed voltage. It never changes.

* The voltage *causes* current to flow. The amount of current depends on what you plug into the outlet. Think of water being forced through a pipe. Narrow pipe, same pressure means less current. The ""narrowness"" of the pipe is known as *impedance*.

* Therefore, the socket is *not* delivering 1.8kW, but instead only the power that is drawn from it, up to that maximum.

* There are three kinds of impedance, all of which reduce the electrical current drawn from the socket: resistance, which converts electrical energy into heat, and inductance and capacitance, which store energy in magnetic and electric fields, and are known jointly as reactive loads.

* Stored energy can be pushed back into the socket, each time the alternating current from the mains switches direction, 120 times per second.

* Even when stored energy is not pushed back into the socket, reactive loads cause the current wave to get out of sync with the voltage wave. Since instantaneous power is voltage multiplied by current, the power is reduced when the two are out of sync, even though the peak current and peak voltage remain the same.

* A reactive load which does this is said to have a *power factor* of less than one.

* Transformers are inductive loads.

So in summary, your transformer impedes the socket's ability to output 1800 Watts by impeding the current (the flow of electrons), and power is current times voltage. It does this by producing a magnetic field which pulls current in partial opposition to the current in the mains. Not only does it restrict the current, it also has a power factor of less than one, causing current to flow when there is less voltage and vice versa.",1574285348

The only important question here, is whether the bulb location is external (out in the air) or enclosed in a glass cover. Enclosed glass covers keep the heat in. While this won't be a fire hazard, since the original incandescent bulbs would make it really hotter inside, the rise in temperature can damage the LED and/or its electronic ballast.

895,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Magnetic dipole**

A magnetic dipole is the limit of either a closed loop of electric current or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the magnetic moment constant. It is a magnetic analogue of the electric dipole, but the analogy is not complete. In particular, a magnetic monopole, the magnetic analogue of an electric charge, has never been observed. Moreover, one form of magnetic dipole moment is associated with a fundamental quantum property—the spin of elementary particles.

Steps you can take to try to avoid this happening again:

Find out what's on that circuit.  Turn everything in your room on and then go flip the breaker. If you dont know how to do this, have your mom do it.  Now, see if anything else near your room shuts off.  Bathroom fan, hallway lights, I dont know what your house looks like, so just check around.

Second, look around your room. How much do you have running at once?  Charging your phone, your alarm clock, ceiling fan, light, gaming system, monitor/tv, etc, these are all pulling amps whencthey are on, and some draw amperage when off even!

In any case, what I'm gathering is this: 

* With the capacitor in series with the transformer, current starts small and builds up until it trips the breaker
* Without the capacitor, current holds steady at 4A

If that's the case then you have a no-load magnetising current from the transformer of 4A, it requires 4A to energise the coils. That seems very inefficient for mains voltage.

With the capacitor in circuit, you may have a dangerous harmonic circuit that is on a runaway charge between two energy storage devices (transformer/inductor and capacitor) that your circuit breaker is protecting you from.

You should not be able to safely short circuit the secondary terminals at mains voltage. In fact, one of the main factory tests of a transformer is to short the secondary and raise the voltage of the primary with a variac until the HV current reaches the transformer rating. This then determines the transformer impedance, and represents the load-losses of the equipment. Typically this is at 5-10% primary voltage, so if you were to short the transformer secondary you would have a bad time.

If electricity travels through your heart, it'll usually be enough to stop your heartbeat. It only takes about 100mA of current across the heart to induce cardiac arrest.

TLDR: low chance of death unless you were very unlucky",1575577026
943,Damascus879,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I would like to improve on the explanation above. 

Electricity wants to return to the source (in the case of households, back to the transformer outside on the pole or near the street).  Electrons will take the easiest path back. Since you were touching the neutral as well, the electrons will just go through your hand and take the neutral back since it is the most direct path.

If you had not been touching the neutral (say only the insulation in the hot was gone), the most direct path would be via ground (through your body).  In that case it depends on a lot of factors. Resistance of the soil, what surface you're standing on, and what hand your touching with. Touching live components with your left hand is a worst case scenario as the path to ground can go directly through your heart.

These factors also play a role in how quickly the upstream protective device trips.  A high resistance to ground may result in the breaker not tripping due to insufficient current, but still result in a lethal shock since it takes less than an amp to stop your heart. 

Different protective device use different methods to trip. The most common is a breaker which uses thermal and magnetic sensing to trip.

This results in poor circulation of the refrigerant (because the pump wasn't designed to pump gasses) which leads to poor or no cooling.  If the pump runs for a while it will either A) eventually clear the bubbles out and run fine or B) burn up the motor because it's running constantly under inappropriate conditions.

Lightning is only one example of a surge that plug-in protectors cannot and do not protect from.  Other sources include linemen errors, tree rodents, stray cars, utility switching, and wind.

954,encaseme,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"There's a few things about your question that I think are misunderstandings:

1. Solar flares happen all the time, most don't hit earth, and those that do usually do not cause any harm to us on the ground. [Here](http://spaceweather.com/) is a website that shows ""space weather"" noting flares, and other noteworthy incidents.

2. Assuming you're talking about a ""CME"" (coronal mass ejection) which throws billions of tons of material into space; and also causes large powerful twisting of the sun's magnetic field; which affects our own Earth's magnetic field.

So I'm going to answer what I think you're asking :) 

Do you know the basics of ""moving a magnet near a conductive object (such as a wire) induces current in the wire"" (and vice versa)? It's one of the basics of electricity, and how motors, generators, and many electromotive applications function.

The earth's magnetic field can be warped and twisted by the sun's magnetic field; which can happen very rapidly and with great force during a CME. This induces current flow in anything electrically conductive within the magnetic field. Especially very large electrically conductive things (which are more affected by the large magnetic fields because of their size) such as: power lines. It doesn't ""knock out"" electricity, in fact it induces more electricity in the power lines. This ""extra"" energy will disrupt the normal flow of electricity, causing interference, and possibly very large voltage differences; large amounts of current to flow, overloading breakers, creating heat, arcing, etc. This can force the affected portions of the power grid to shut down, in order to protect themselves, while the interference is happening; or cause physical damage if things become too heated, too overvolted, or are sensitive to interference (digital and analog control circuits, etc).

So, it can remove the possibility of getting electricity in the future if it knocks out the power grid; but only incidentally (due to damage incurred) not directly. If you had a generator or something locally it would very likely be fine (something that small isn't going to be greatly affected by the huge size of the earth's magnetic field). Any electronics (including sections of power grid, houses, home electronics, businesses, cars, etc) that were not affected by the initial interference would be just fine to continue operating.

So, to sum up:

1. I think you're asking about CMEs, not flares
2. Most things will continue to work unless a particularly strong event happens
3. The issue is that the earth's magnetic field is moved by the sun's which moves around a lot during a CME, moving magnetic fields induce current flow in conductors
3. The power grid is most at risk because of its size, things connected to it are at risk (anything plugged in) but there is isolation of sorts in place in the power grid that would make it unlikely to damage things plugged in unless there is a particularly strong event.",1501695828

956,encaseme,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"""EMP"" is a sort of generic term that can mean more than one things.

Basically though, you can shield against an EMP the same way you would shield something electrically and/or magnetically - a metal box is one basic example, a [Faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) specifically. No shields are ""perfect"" shields, in that they reduce the effect of external electromagnetic fields, but do not eliminate it. The difficulty is - most of our devices that we use are interconnected. Even if the device itself is shielded, there is often a way in and out of the shielding - otherwise the device is likely not particularly useful for anything.

Satellites are generally hardened to higher levels of radiation (EM and otherwise) than we experience here on the ground (because of our lovely Earth's protective magnetosphere and atmosphere); yet they manage to operate in sometimes very severe environments. Things can be designed to be shielded correctly. The issue is - nothing on the ground is typically designed this way (generally only designed to tolerate local EM fields, such as electric motors, etc); so yes an EMP weapon could potentially be very damaging to any sensitive electronics. It would be quite difficult to do any widespread damage though; nuclear type weapons level stuff.

You can think of an EMP's effects similar to a lightning strike on a house - it's going to cause issues, but can be mitigated by just unplugging/covering things - but again the problem is knowing when this is going to happen, and an unplugged TV isn't very interesting to have in the first place :) 

So again to sum up :) :

1. Yes, a metal box would probably be sufficient in many cases; we have EM shielding all around us for comparatively very weak EM fields (not weaponized).
2. It's hard to keep something in a metal box all the time, and ensuring shielded connections to the outside world is expensive; you may as well not have it in the first place, so we don't generally over-shield stuff; unless we know we're sending stuff to a dangerous EM area (like outer space).
3. EMP on the scale of something you'd have to worry about would be caused by something like a nuclear blast or a huge space-event - in which case you have other things to worry about anyway. ",1501789648
957,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Faraday cage**

A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material or in the case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented them in 1836.



A Faraday cage operates because an external electrical field causes the electric charges within the cage's conducting material to be distributed such that they cancel the field's effect in the cage's interior.

(This would not be the case with real transformers as power would be lost due to the resistance of the windings etc.) Power = Current x Voltage and (Ohm’s Law) V (Voltage) = I (Current) x R (Resistance). Since the transmission lines have some finite amount of resistance R, the power lost in the transmission lines as heat due to this resistance = I^2 x R. (Using Ohm’s Law to eliminate V from the power equation). Because in an ideal transformer, the input and output power must be equal, the product of the current and voltage on the input and output sides must be equal. This means that if you use a step up transformer to increase the voltage, the current must decrease (To maintain the same power). This means that because the current travelling through the transmission lines is less, the power lost in the lines due to heating is less: P = I^2 x R. For example, if you were to half the current travelling through the transmission lines (for the same length of line and resistance), the power lost would be 25% of the original value.

968,RickyNut,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It's a multipart answer:

1. As people have mentioned, for AC, all you need is a transformer, essentially a big coil of wire to go from one voltage level to the next. It works on the principle of mutual inductance and is very simple.
2. Higher voltage means lower current. Lower current means less heat. Less heat means less losses. Less heat also means you don't need as large diameter of conductor to carry energy. Thus, your conductor can be smaller and reduce cost.
3. DC requires expensive power electronics that require fairly constant maintenance. DC only has less losses than AC at voltages around 700,000V+. 
4. The protection and breakers on the bulk power system rely on AC being present. The existing relays and protective devices that look for issues like lightening strikes or trees falling into lines rely on AC current and voltage in order to properly protect the line. DC is a LOT more complicated to protect because those sinusoidal quantities aren't present.
5. Electricity is also inherently generated via AC (unless is PV Solar). To convert it to DC requires additional power electronics and/or a motor/generator set with commutator windings that convert it to DC (the old-school way of making DC). So the question got asked, ""If we already generate AC, why do we need to go back to DC when all we need to transport this is a transformer?"" A valid question.

1. The maximum charging rate of the battery - This depends on the battery chemistry, physical construction, age, temperature, etc. It is usually defined in the battery spec as a ""C"" rating, which is a multiple of the capacity of the battery. For example, a 2AH battery with a 0.2C charge rating can be charged with 2*0.2=0.4A of current safely. 
2. The charging circuit - If the charging circuit is not able to provide the full ""C"" rating of the battery, it will charge more slowly; depending on the capacity of the circuit
3. The power supply - if the charging circuit is not able to draw its full capacity of energy from the power supply (whether it be another battery, or a transformer, solar panel, wall plug, etc), it will charge more slowly.

There are no battery chemistries that I know of that are able to be charged in seconds, no matter how much energy you put into them. If you attempt to charge a battery above its ""C"" rating, it'll likely catch fire, and with Lithium chemistries (among others) will likely explode violently.

In your example above, it depends if the AA batteries are the bottleneck for the charging setup - if they can supply more current than the charging circuit or the battery itself can take, then they would charge the battery exactly as fast as the car battery would be able to. 

Capacitors are able to be charged in seconds (or faster) but they are much less energy-dense (by both weight and volume) than batteries; so there are tradeoffs, even with today's ""super capacitors"" which can be rated for multiple farads of capacity.

The likelihood of the ground being the problem climbs significantly if the wiring of your house is from the 1950's or earlier when it was uncommon to have a separate earth ground path in the wiring.  Unfortunately, as other users have said, this can be expensive to fix properly. 

An inexpensive solution does exist though if you live in such a place that you have access to your yard or the meter base.

2) Some wire, small gauge is fine, #18 or larger.

3) A way to bond said wire to adapter plug tab (screw or clamp).

4) A wire clamp to bond your small gauge wire to either your ground wire or the ground rod. 

The part that is frequently ignored is that little tab on top of the third / earth hole.  Recall now where the ground rod was located when the serviceman visited.  Install a wire into a three hole to two hole adapter and run it from the outlet to the meter ground or ground rod.   Evaluate your results.  

Doing this will bypass the earth-ground return path in your household wiring (if it's even there).  If this fixes your problem and it seems worth it to fix, prepare for a wiring project in your house.  If you're satisfied with the jethro ground you just installed, keep it. 

If the jethro ground did NOT fix your problem the issue may lie with your laptop power supply or laptop itself.

980,WFOMO,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"If you have a smart meter, most utilities (depending on their software) can read hourly intervals. Most of them also make those graphs available on-line in their customer support sections. Ask.

If you have a conventional disk meter, you can look at the nameplate and there will be a ""Kh"" with a number behind it (typically 3.6 or 7.2). This is called constant of the meter and is the energy per revolution of the disk in watts (not kilowatts). 

So if your Kh=7.2, every time the disk completes a revolution, you've used 7.2 watts. If it goes around once in an hour, you've used 1 watthour. If it goes around 1000 times in an hour, you used 1 Kwh. So you can time the disk revolutions to calculate your usage.

For example, you time the disk for 10 revolutions and it takes 60 seconds. Each revolution was 7.2 watts so you used 72 watts in 60 seconds. Divide that by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour) and you'll have the watt hours.

I guess you can understand how when you connect the hot remains of the fencer to the the fence, that the pulses of high voltage electricity can travel along that metallic fence wire for miles, as its metal, probably steel fencing wire, and steel wire is a good conductor of electricity, yes?

Thus I guess what you actually find puzzling is how this ground stuff works, how you shove a couple of rods into the soil, and somehow it provides the return path through the animal’s legs (or your legs, if you touch the fence!), back to the ground terminal on the fencer.

For the animal to get shocked, it has to come between the hot and ground terminal of the fencer.  So the hot terminal goes to the fence, and the ground terminal goes to the ground rod or maybe ground rods if you have a long fence, or poor or dry soil conditions where the riots are.  You want the rods to have a good connection to ground.

Well, that soil stuff has a magic property.  If you can shove an electrode into the planet, like you do with your fencer earth rods, then you can shove another electrode into the planet anywhere else, and make contact with that first electrode, and it doesn’t matter how far apart those electrodes are, *anywhere* on the planet, they make the same contact, technically, they have the same resistance between them.  This was (and still is) very handy for submarine cable under the sea for communications, initially Lin the early 1800s, sending Morse code between America and the UK, using a single wire under the sea, and the earth as the other conductor.

Back the electric fences; this means that because you’ve got your earth rods in, it doesn’t matter how far away your electric fence stretches, if there is still power in the fence, the soil ground path will still work as a return path to make sure the animal gets shocked.

1013,moldboy,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"OK.  This is going to be a long one

&gt; Anyway, sooo, the concept that voltage is a difference in potential energy between two points kind of threw me. Then the idea that two resistors in series causes a voltage drop between them also threw me. And that the voltage between two points on the outside of those resistors is the same as the power source voltage threw me kind of. Then current being constant across the entire circuit threw me.
I always imagined circuits as pipes with water in them, like Feynman explained, where voltage is the pressure in the pipes (the force causing the water to move), the current is the speed of the water through the pipes, and the resistance is whatever, blockages in the pipe or the diameter of the pipe slowing down the current.

So the first thing to understand is that the analogy you've mentioned is essentially correct it falls apart a little bit in more complex electronics but it is generally correct.  It even works mathematically.  But there's something you may not realize.  Pressure (like PSI, or kPa, or bar) is a actually represented as a difference just like voltage.  A plumber might tell you that the pressure coming out of the tap is 40 psi.  That's actually 40 psi above atmospheric pressure.  so, the pressure of the water on the ground is 0psi and the pressure at the tap is 40 psi.  So just like voltage is a measurement of difference so is pressure.  That needs to be considered to understand the analogy.  An easier way to think about this is using pressure ""head"".  Pumps are specified in head which is roughly the vertical distance they are able to pump a fluid.  So head is measured in feet or meters.  You can also get head in a tank, the water level in the tank is the ""head"".  As the water runs out of the tank the head drops (and so does the pressure).

In a piping system it is possible to measure flow through the pipe by measuring the pressure drop across a known restriction.  The formula (very simple) is Q = sqrt(dP)/K (this equation only holds true for turbulent flow...)

- Q is flow.
- dP is pressure drop.  We take the square root because water moves differently than electrons.
- K is a constant representing the amount of restriction.

Of course this looks a lot like I=V/R (ohms law!)

&gt; Well if resistance slows down the current I was thinking, that the water flowing through the ""resistor"" (clump of hair or whatever) would be slower than elsewhere in the system, so how could current be constant? I then thought of it like a traffic jam. If there is a circular road, and all the cars are going at a constant speed through the circuit, if there is a car accident at some point (the resistor) everyone will stop to look at it, which slows down the cars behind them, etc. until the entire circuit is slow moving cars, so I THINK I kind of understand constant current through a circuit? Can anyone tell me if this is a good analogy?

You should stick with the water analogy.  You're thinking about the speed of the water... you need to think about the flow of the water.  Let's change your example a little and replace the hair with a valve which can be open or closed or anywhere in between.  That is the same thing as a variable resistor (a potentiometer, or pot).  So if you have a tank with a pipe attached and somewhere on the line there is a valve.  The tank has some pressure because of the elevation of the water.  If you open the valve a little the water will start to flow out of the tank.  If you open it more it will flow faster.  If you measured the flow along that pipe anywhere it would be the same.  Think about it like this:  If you put the output of the pipe into a 5 gallon bucket and it took 1 minute to fill up the water is entering the bucket at 5gal/min.  If you poured a new 5 gallon bucket of water into the tank every minute then the tank would never empty because the flow leaving the tank is the same as the flow leaving the hose.  It stands to logic that the flow everywhere in the pipe is exactly the same.  That's how current in a circuit works.  It is worth noting that the actual water ""particles"" would be traveling different speeds at different points in the pipe (and around the valve) but that's physics and outside of this analogy.

&gt; Then for voltage dividers (with 2 resistors), I'm still really confused. If I go back to the water pressure analogy I can kind of think of high pressure before the first blockage (1st resistor), less pressure after the first blockage, and even less pressure after the second blockage (2nd resistor). 

Exactly.  Back to the tank.  If you have two valves with some pipe in between.  Each valve is open partially.  You will have one pressure at the outlet of the tank, a lower pressure between the two valves and an even lower pressure after the last valve.   

&gt; Before and after both blockages (both resistors), we have a high difference (let's imagine a voltage difference of 9 volts). Before and after the first blockage, there is a difference but it's less than the difference between before and after both blockages (let's say half, 4.5V). And vice versa, from before the second blockage and after it (if the resistance is the same, another 4.5V difference).
But now I'm stuck with the question if there is only one blockage in a circuit (one resistor), why is the difference just as large before and after it, if it only has half the resistance? What is causing it to lose all that ""water pressure""?

In the tank analogy the water is going from some high pressure (let's say 10 psi) to 0 psi because it's running onto the ground which has no extra pressure.  If you have 1 valve you are dropping 10 psi from the top of the tank to the ground.  (some of that pressure is dropping along the pipe too, just like some voltage is dropping along the wire)  If you have two identical valves the pressure in between them is 5 psi.  In the case of the tank you have 10 psi because that's what water does in a tank.  In an electrical system you have 9V because that's what voltage is.  The only way for electricity to flow is through voltage drop just like the only way to have water flow is to have pressure drop.  I'm not sure if that clarifies the point or confuses it more, hopefully the former.

&gt; Also when they say voltage is difference in voltage form one point to another, if we have a 9V battery in a circuit with one resistor, what is the typical initial voltage being measured, and what is the final voltage near the end to calculate the delta V? It's probably not 9 and 0 respectively, right? (is it like 209 and 200V? 100,000,009 and 100,000,000 V? 10 and 1 V?) 

Correct.  That's one of the reasons we measure voltage as a difference.  In complex circuits we ground things which references them to ""ground"" which is a conceptual 0V.  In big power systems lots of energy is expended producing a ground system to ensure that the ground stays at the same ""zero volts"".  That's very much outside of scope of this post.  Just know that many people with engineering degrees and many years of experience don't understand completely. (some people do, but to many it's not clear, so don't feel bad).

A voltage meter has two probes because you are measuring a difference between them.  You can think about it like distance between cities.  You can't say that city A is 500 miles.  You have to say it's 500 miles away from something else.

&gt; Even with a long circuit, the voltage difference will be 5V if measuring from the farthest two points, but if you measured at two points that are getting infinitely close together (even before a resistor), isn't the voltage difference STILL 5V? How is that possible?

I'm not sure I understand ""long circuit"" you mean long wires?  No, just like you drop voltage across a resistor you also drop voltage across wires just that in most cases the ""load"" (resistor, motor, lamp, etc) is often much larger than the wire.  Generally home wiring is designed to drop less than 5% of the total voltage across the wire.  The more current you have the more voltage you loose across the wire.  This generates heat and is why you have circuit breakers in your home wiring.

&gt; Anyway, I know a lot of my analogies may be flawed and probably completely wrong, but I feel like without having a good picture in my head and understanding the answers to these questions, I can't really understand the nature of electricity as intuitively as I would like to. It's a 101 course and I think my professor just wants me to know the facts, that this happens, but I'd really like to know why. Can anyone help?

The actual ""why"" these things happen is complex physics and you probably won't ever properly understand.  But I know what you mean.  You start by memorizing the rules, but it helps to ""understand"" them.  I do think the water analogy is the best, but it also helps to get some resistors and a battery and just play around.

Since electric current is invisible and the processes at play in electronics are often difficult to demonstrate, the various electronic components are represented by hydraulic equivalents. Electricity (as well as heat) was originally understood to be a kind of fluid, and the names of certain electric quantities (such as current) are derived from hydraulic equivalents. As with all analogies, it demands an intuitive and competent understanding of the baseline paradigms (electronics and hydraulics).

1016,moldboy,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It occurs to me that this might be the kind of thing you learn in school and that I'm not helping.

Thing about this.  Electrical current is the moving of charges (coulombs) through conductors.  One volt is actually 1 joule/coulomb.  So voltage is a representation of how much energy every charge has.  I said that the voltage across the resistor would be 0 of you disconnect the battery because no charge is flowing.  That's like saying that it takes energy for the charges to move.  If they aren't moving then the joules/coulomb stay the same, there is no difference.

Current, or Amps can also be represented as coloumb/second.  Or how much charge moves every second.  Think about it like runners on an obstacle course.  If they are all just standing around you can measure how much energy each of them have and they will all be the same... so the energy difference between any two runners will be the same (v=0).  If they start walking the track then you can measure the energy of the runner before and after they've climbed an obstacle.  They will have lost energy going through an obstacle and you will be able to measure a difference.  If they start running the course then the energy used to go through a particular obstacle will be higher.  This is like saying that the voltage drop across a fixed resistance goes up if the current goes up.  If you could quantify how dificult the course is we would call that resistance and the maximum speed the runners would be able to go would be based on how much energy they all had at the beginning.  So you'd say the current (runner speed) is total energy/course difficulty... or I=V/R. 

Maybe that made it worse.  Hopefully not.  I've always liked this: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*RdIDFWX6ZWlB1Jbjf5rpsw.jpeg ",1507489608

  Electricity is all about flow in circuits, its a chain that if broken will stop working if there is no return path.

1021,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"There is plenty of movement of electrons, actually, and that's where all of it happens. With a light bulb, the flow of electrons through the circuit and tungsten filament causes some electrons to excite, that is they have more energy and move to a higher energy state, a region further from the atom. When they relax back down to their normal state they give off this energy as heat and light. It's primarily this effect that gives a filament its resistance, which is the reason they draw power.

To understand how current relates to the movement of electrons, first you have to understand how current is measured. For DC it's simple, you have a positive pole and a negative pole and a current flows between them, the only confusing part is the convention that current flows + to - while electrons travel the other way. This is because current was defined before electrons were known to even exist, or at least to be involved. With DC current you have two measurements of electron movement, the drift current and the drift velocity. Drift current is the conventional current, is just below the speed of light and is basically a measure of the instantaneous effect of switching on a light - the electrons by the switch haven't got to the light yet, but because the electrons all start moving at once the light turns on immediately. Drift velocity is the actual movement of electrons along an electric field, which is much slower as the electrons are slowed down by bumping into atoms and not really going in a straight line with the field.

AC is a little more complex (heh), as with AC the current and voltage are both alternating from positive to negative peaks in a sine wave, 50 or 60 times per second. However we still measure this with a positive number as RMS values - Root Mean Square, that is you square every current value over the wave, take the average then take the square root. For example, a 120V RMS system has voltage oscillating from +169.7V to -169.7V at 60Hz, so 60 times per second. The current is proportional to this, in relation to the impedance (similar to resistance) of the load. So if the current is oscillating, that means the electric field oscillates and the electrons are also oscillating, somewhat, as they bounce from atom to atom in a 3D plane with a 2D oscillating electric field across them.",1565425022

1026,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"[Spot welders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_welding) do not use an arc to weld. You electrode clamp the two sheets of metal together and pass a high current trough them. The resistance heating melts the region between the electrodes. Ideally, no sparks are generated. They often are, but are molten metal flying out. Not electric arcs. You want low voltage, like a few volts, at very high current. So for a typical 1000W MOT, and say 5 volts secondary, you could get up to 200 amps at the weld spot. You will need very heavy wire, actually multiple strands of smaller wire. To make it easier to wind. Like 10x strands of #12AWG wires in parallel. And like 1/2 inch copper rod to make the electrodes.

&gt;Resistance spot welding (RSW)[1] is a process in which contacting metal surface points are joined by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current. It is a subset of electric resistance welding.

&gt;Work-pieces are held together under pressure exerted by electrodes. Typically the sheets are in the 0.5 to 3 mm (0.020 to 0.118 in) thickness range. The process uses two shaped copper alloy electrodes to concentrate welding current into a small ""spot"" and to simultaneously clamp the sheets together. Forcing a large current through the spot will melt the metal and form the weld. The attractive feature of spot welding is that a lot of energy can be delivered to the spot in a very short time (approximately 10–100 milliseconds).[2] That permits the welding to occur without excessive heating of the remainder of the sheet.",1508367320

1037,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The Watt (Joule per second) defines power.  

The Coulomb is the SI unit for an static electric charge. 

The Ampere defines current and is expressed as coulomb per second.  

The Volt defines electrical potential energy and can be expressed as Joule per Coulomb

So, an example:
Let’s say you have two ideal conductive spheres in a vacuum.  One of them is loaded down with electrons and is negatively charged.  The other is neutral charged.  

There is a potential difference in energy between the two spheres (voltage) because of the difference in charge (coulombs). But no current (amperage) because there is no exchange of charge and no (wattage) because there is no current.  

Let’s now put a non-ideal wire between the spheres.

The energy begins transferring between the two spheres.  Since they are static charged, the difference in charge (voltage) is equalizing.

There is current (amperes) passing through the wire we introduced.  Since this wire is not ideal it is resisting the free flow of electrons slightly.  Because of this resistance to flow, some energy must be expended as heat to move the charge from the charged sphere to the other one.  Since we are in an ideal vacuum, this heat remains on the non-ideal wire (let’s assume the spheres do not conduct heat).  The heated wire has slightly higher resistance than the non heated wire due to atomic behavior of the metal (seek elsewhere for this explanation, lots of reading on why this is). Over time, the resistance of the wire will rise as the heat rises.  This requires increasing amounts of energy (watts) to move the charge from sphere A to sphere B from one second to the next.  

In the real world, this resistance to flow accounts for heat losses in a system.  This heat is typically picked up by air or some other apparatus designed to transfer heat away from the system.  To transfer electrical energy (watts) from point A to point B some of that energy (Joules) will be lost as heat.

1046,Roast_A_Botch,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"To expand the other comment, and answer what I think you're asking, in principle you could move electrons back and forth until the end of the universe.  But, batteries rely on chemistry to facilitate the transfer of current, and each cycle breaks down anode, cathode, electrolyte, terminals, etc.  Which limits the total amount of cycles the battery can perform.

There are other charge storing devices that put batteries to shame for lifetime though, Capacitors.  They do the same thing as batteries, but electrostatically instead of electrochemically.  There's also electromechanical storage, such as flywheels or water towers, that also have unlimited cycles in theory(but are limited by wear of materials and maintenance).  I have some capacitors that are over a century old, and still operate.  My air dielectric ones will last as long as I don't allow them to rust.  You could make an air capacitor with platinum or another non-oxidizing conductor, send it into space, and as long as it doesn't collide with something it will operate as new 1 million years from now.  Even modern film/foil caps will outlast anyone alive today, and be usable for their grandkids as long as they're stored properly.

Outside of battery's and other storage, the biggest loss of usable electricity is conducted away as heat due to resistance in the device and circuit.  When charging a battery, it will increase in temperature and this is from heat loss.  But, it isn't removing from the battery's total store of electrons, rather the battery has resistance against the charging source, so you'll have to put in more total energy than the battery can store, in order to account for the energy lost as heat(that every isn't actually lost, just transformed and can be reclaimed).  The amount of electrons don't really matter for electricity purposes though, just the ability to move them around.

In theory, you'd only need a single unit of charge to run any device.  Alternating Current, the mains electric in your home, cycles between positive and negative charge, and in theory is moving a single electron, proton, and neutron back and forth at a certain frequency.

Charge (""number of electrons accumulated on your skin"") is equal to the capacitance (""ability to store charge"") multiplied by the voltage of the electrons (""how much energy each electron has"").

The Electrostatic Discharge Association's figure for the capacitance of a human is 100pF - a capacitor on a modest power supply might have a million times more capacitance at 100uF.

Carpets can produce thousands of volts of when rubbed compared to a battery's 12. This large potential causes a larger number of electrons to accumulate in a small space, resulting in both a high voltage and a high charge on your skin.

If you hold a battery terminal in each hand, you'll give away just as many electrons to the battery's positive terminal as you receive from its negative one. If you hold just one terminal AND ground the other AND avoid grounding yourself, then you will acquire a small charge, but only until you reach 12 volts.

Q = 12V x 100pF = 1.2 nano Coulombs.

Energy = Charge x Voltage = 1.2e^-9 x 12 = 14.4 nano Joules.

But, with a greater surplus of electrons forced into your body by the carpet's higher potential, you would acquire more charge, and at a higher voltage, say 10000 volts:

E = QV x V = QV² = 100e^-12 x 10000² = 1 Joule of energy.

For reference, a pellet from an airsoft gun might have 1J of kinetic energy when it leaves the barrel, so you'd still feel a zap at even less than the 10kV above.

1082,DurianExecutioner,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt; Does this mean I can't use a multimeter to measure anything that is going to heat up, once connected to a circuit?

Technically yes, but incandescent lightbulbs' filaments reach temperatures of thousands of degrees, whereas ordinary components such as resistors are unlikely to exceed 70°C or so in a well designed circuit. So temperature is much less of a factor usually.

&gt; This seems odd, wouldn't it mean that on my car, the current spikes to 24A every time the turn signal lights up ?

According to [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb) the resistance in a domestic bulb goes from about 10 ohms when dark to about 150 ohms in about 0.1 seconds. So the actual duration of the current spike is quite low. But you are absolutely correct: and indeed the same article notes that tungsten lamps have a high *inrush current*.

&gt; The kid in the video can light up his bulb just fine, do car light bulbs have lower resistances than regular ones?

I have no idea what 'regular' is in this context. 12V lamps are designed with different power ratings depending on the application.

If you were to connect a high power 12V light bulb across an inadequate 12V battery, then the battery's output voltage would drop, more energy would be dissipated by the battery's internal resistance, and the current would drop. Presumably the lamp in the video draws a small amount of current and the battery is able to keep up.",1578790562

1086,xveganxcowboyx,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Are you able to reduce the flow of your pumps some and still achieve the effect you want? If so I would switch to 12v DC pumps and eliminate the inverter entirely. In this case the inverter is introducing extra conversion losses as well as decreasing safety (12v is essentially harmless, but 120v can be deadly in some circumstances). You also may be able to get a charge controller which can also act as the timer, which would save that complication as well.

In either case, you need to work backwards. Start with your pumps power consumption. You have three pumps at 30w each. That is 90w total. You need to multiply that by the total time the pumps run per day. Let's use 4 hours as an example.

90w x 4hrs = 360 watt hours per day. 

You can't count on the sun every day. Depending on your local conditions how much extra capacity you need will vary, but I'll suggest a baseline of three days battery capacity.

360w/h x 3 = 1080w/h 

So you need 1080 of functional battery capacity. Depending on your battery type you will need different total base capacities, since the functional capacity (the amount you can draw without degrading the battery significantly) varies.

Standard lead acid car battery (I do NOT recommend this) is about 20% useable. That gives you 1080w/h / 0.20 = 5,400w/h of total capacity.

Deep cycle/agm/golf cart lead acid (usually the smart choice) is about 50%. 1080w/h / 0.5 = 2160w/h total capacity.

Lithium (awesome, but expensive) is about 80% available. 1080w/h / 0.80 = 1,350w/h total capacity. 

That gives you your batteries if using 12v pumps. If using an inverter and timer you will need to add in the power draw of the timer and add ~20% capacity for inefficiency of the power conversion and the motors being on cheap modified sine power (this could be lower with quality components).

Panels are harder to size, because so much depends on your specific location. There are online calculators for latitude, regional sun exposure, and the direction and angle of your panels. You'll want to use one of those and size off the lowest producing month in your area. You'll also need to check the location you are using for shading. On smaller/cheaper panels any shading will pretty much kill production so count only the shade free hours for production. The number you are shooting for should be something like 120% of your daily consumption to account for charge conversion losses. In this hypothetical scenario that would be solar production of 432w/h per day.

I am in St Paul, MN so I ran some calculations around that area as an example. My local minimum sun exposure is 2.6 hours. That means I would need 432w/h / 2.6 = 166w of solar.  The site I used was a little more conservative than I was and suggested 180w of solar. In either case I would buy 2 100w panels for convenience. If you have shading in the winter you would need to reduce the sun exposure accordingly (you will be oversized in other seasons so some shading is probably acceptable). If you are somewhat east or west or at a suboptimal angle (varies by latitude) you'll want to account for that, 10-20% is a ballpark range.",1578804033

Depending on the system setup and the ability of the ground to provide a return path, distribution conductors generally are in sets of three near the start.  Dual circuits(three on either side) are not uncommon near the distribution step down transformers.

Now comes the break downs and examples of different options, from there it is not unusual for a spur line to have two conductors in rural areas for example to farm houses or pump stations.

  They T-off from the main three conductors and they are balanced by the network engineers changing which phase(red-white-blue) is taken on each spur line so the system doesnt unbalance using too much off any one phase in the whole circuit.

In very rural hard to get places with a good earth return they might run a single overhead wire using the SWER system (single wire earth return) with special subtransformers with more rigorous earthing(cutting these can result in high voltage across the break).

In places where there is high resistance in the ground they may run an aerial earth, I have seen these both above(for bonus lightning protection) and below the active conductors.

Feel free to ask more questions to narrow down what you are talking about.

So in the rare occasion that the earth resistance is high you could have two actives and earth or three actives and earth for distribution.

Now onto low voltage.. 

If you have three phases coming in to the sub then the LV will have three phases and a nuetral coming out. On rare or old systems there may also be a switch wire for turning on the lights(normally much smaller conductor).

If you have two phases coming into the sub you will have two phases and a nuetral.

If you have SWER(single wire) you get two phases and a nuetral coming out.

There are also variations of LV conductor like ABC(aerial bundled cable) which is three phases and a nuetral all coated to prevent any issues.

Now on our magical mystery tour of conductors there are many extra types for communications.

  Where there is no service of any kind on the cell network, distribution poles may have trunking wire(mostly this is for really old subtransmission  lines but some countries..) which runs the safety and switching systems information.

1096,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Electrical grid**

An electrical grid, electric grid or power grid, is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from producers to consumers. It consists of:

generating stations that produce electric power

electrical substations for stepping electrical voltage up for transmission, or down for distribution

high voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand-centers

distribution lines that connect individual customersElectrical grids vary in size from covering a single building through national grids (which cover whole countries) to transnational grids (which can cross continents).

Power stations connected to grids are often located near energy resources such as a source of fuel or to take advantage of renewable energy resources, and away from heavily-populated areas. A bulk-power transmission network is therefore used to move the power long distances, sometimes across international boundaries, until it reaches its wholesale customer (usually the organisation that owns the local electric power distribution network).

The systems required to be grounded are:

* Any system that can be grounded so that the maximum voltage-to-ground doesn’t exceed 150V
* A 3-phase, 4-wire Wye system that uses the neutral as a circuit conductor, and
* A 3-phase, 4-wire Delta system that has a circuit conductor that connects to the midpoint of one of the phase windings

1101,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt;I have an energized floating ground cable, charged with electrons waiting to discharge. If this was a DC circuit, the ground cable would represent the negative terminal, the wall the positive terminal, and touching them both would complete the circuit. 100V should be plenty to break whatever resistance there is, and whatever current is on the ground terminal, should discharge to earth, through the wall. Where am I mistaken? 

The cable may be energised, but it almost certainly isn't energised to 100V. As I said, to measure the induced voltage in the cable you need to measure the voltage across the cable from end to end. 

Your other measurements measure the potential difference between a point on the cable and a point on another cable or on the wall. They're not necessarily in phase with each other, and furthermore the meter will be displaying its calculated RMS value so if the waveform is abnormal then it could throw it off even more.

&gt;Well in that case I would immagine I wouldn't get any voltage between it and the live. I could short it to the live and nothing would happen because of the high impedance, right? 

If the wall is high impedance you would see a voltage, but you would not get much if any current flow. 

&gt;In this case why doesn't it? Why do I still read 100V even while shorting it? 

Because 100V is the measurement between a changing voltage and a floating changing voltage. If the wall is insulating then touching copper onto it won't make the wall the same potential as the copper.

&gt;This is the thing I don't understand. Doesn't the meter measure the difference in electric charge/potential, between one probe and the other? Doesn't it reference one probe's potential, to the other? 

It does, but these are AC voltages so the voltages are constantly changing. The meter works by measuring the voltage at discrete time intervals and then calculates a Root Mean Square (RMS) voltage. The actual peak voltages on a 230V RMS system will be +/- 325V.

If you have two voltages in phase (or 180 degrees out of phase) then they can be added as a simple sum, but if the voltages are out of phase then when they combine it isn't a straight sum of the voltages. For example, in a 3-phase 230V system you have 3 phases that are 230V phase to neutral and 120 degrees out of phase with one another, but the voltage between any two phases is 400V.

With the voltages here, nothing is in phase with each other. Any induced voltage won't necessarily be in phase with the supply voltage, in fact it almost always isn't.

&gt;Well don't the specifications share the same ground? The ground taken from the grounding rod/pin may not be identical to the ground taken from my wall, but I don't think that there could be a difference of more than a couple volts, at most.

Not necessarily. Earthing designs have to be based on the soil conditions in the specific site location. Like I say, the resistance of different soils varies, in fact it varies in all directions from A to B as well as with depth, and the voltages at two different points in the ground can be different. This needs to be considered when connecting different earthing systems together, as you can end up with circulating currents through the earthing system. 

The earthing system is more of about modelling electrical faults through the soil than specific conductor design. So, earthing design considers current flow through soil and other high impedance objects, while circuit design considers current flow in low impedance conductors. By measuring both at the same time your measurements don't provide anywhere near the same level of useful information.",1578996530

In electronics, a voltage divider  (also known as a potential divider) is a passive linear circuit that produces an output voltage (Vout) that is a fraction of its input voltage (Vin). Voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider. A simple example of a voltage divider is two resistors connected in series, with the input voltage applied across the resistor pair and the output voltage emerging from the connection between them.

Resistor voltage dividers are commonly used to create reference voltages, or to reduce the magnitude of a voltage so it can be measured, and may also be used as signal attenuators at low frequencies.

The lead–acid battery was invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté and is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. These features, along with their low cost, make them attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors.

As they are inexpensive compared to newer technologies, lead–acid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher energy densities.

The simplest of these circuits are a form of rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input. DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching.

If you don't have anything big running it is likely a short somewhere and/or a bad breaker in which case you may need an electrician to track it down.  If your main breaker is tripping than that means it's either the sum of several circuits combining to overload your main panel or a breaker is faulty and not tripping when it should be which is a serious fire hazard.",1580167410

you should unplug all big appliances like heaters, boilers etc and see if it happens again

if it does not, turn them on one by one to see which one will tip the breaker, and that is the faulty one

if it does its probably faulty breaker, or even problem with wires/installation which is unlikely

OK so let's assume that there's a tear in the wire and the conductor gets exposed to the water.

Your electricity first enters your house at the electrical panel, where the circuit breakers are located.  These sense if an excess amount of electrical current is passing through them.  So if it detects more than about 15 amps of current on a typical breaker, it will trigger and open the circuit.

You can see that it's very difficult to get significantly shocked this way, because you essentially have to touch both wires anyway.

Where people typically shock themselves is by accidentally touching a live wire while they touch the metal of the sink or similar. This is where the GFCI comes in to protect you.

During space weather events, electric currents in the magnetosphere and ionosphere experience large variations, which manifest also in the Earth's magnetic field. These variations induce currents (GIC) in conductors operated on the surface of Earth. Electric transmission grids and buried pipelines are common examples of such conductor systems.

So let's talk about receptacles first and then I'll discuss installing your new graphics card.

A standard NEMA 5-15 receptacle that you find in your home has two vertical blades and a pin. The larger blade, often on the left, is your ""hot"" wire and is the wire delivering power from the power bar inside your breaker/fuse box, through a breaker/fuse, to the fixture you're running. The other blade is your grounding wire, or ""neutral"", and runs to the neutral bar inside your breaker/fuse box before finding a path to ground. The pin, often on the bottom, is your grounded wire or simply ""ground"".

The purpose of your neutral is to provide a steady path for electricity to flow once it leaves your fixture and heads for ground, often literally a simple wire run into the ground. The ground wire, however, is there as a safety feature to let any stray electricity (say from a short circuit) take a path to ground really fast and trip the breaker/fuse.

As far as installing your graphics card, you should be just fine so long as you make sure to ground yourself on the metal case (power supply preferred). In the case of the computer, your power supply acts as a kind of multiplex for all these wires to get power to the various components. The case serves as a ground because it ties to the power supply and serves the same propose as the grounded wire above, to protect the equipment.

Closing the curtains during the day, especially on the sunny side of the house, can be a really effective way of keeping the house cool and reducing the amount of work the AC has to do, especially if those curtains are white. It might also be worthwhile making sure that the air con's ducts, grills and radiators are free from dust and other obstructions.

Daily showers can cost a lot in water heating, especially during the winter. We used to wash with basin and rag two days out of three and washed our hair by pouring water over it from a large jug as needed. It saves a huge amount of water too.

It's amazing how much difference simply getting acclimatised to the seasonal temperature can make. In the winter, I avoid spending hours in the warm, or I dress lightly if, for example, the office is over-heated. In the summer, the opposite. The body gets used to regulating its temperature for the prevailing conditions and you may find you can turn down the AC or heating at home.

If you own the house, then (non-fake) external window shutters could be a good investment: an example of the Passive House principle. So could, potentially, be having the water heater and AC serviced. If you have a hot water tank, then super insulation around the tank and/or solar hot water might be worth looking into.

Finally, appliances: de-ice the refrigerator and freezer and make sure their radiators have good air flow, turn off the computer when not in use, dust inside the computer including the heat sinks (but follow precautions to avoid damage), dry clothes on a line when the weather permits instead of using a dryer (or hang them up inside but watch our for damp), buy washing powder or sodium percarbonate that can work at lower temperatures.

Oh and cooking: it is rarely worth putting the oven on for a single item like a pizza or roast meat. Microwaves are the most efficient but stir frying is pretty decent. Boiling water in an electric kettle is much more efficient than boiling it in a pan, even on a gas cooker: if I'm boiling something I'll tend to heat the water in the kettle and then pour it into a pan when it's up to temperature.

1193,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The electrons repel away from the source (assuming using the negative terminal), through the resistor. It is like a gas expanding. It wants to expand to the lowest energy state. That is with the electrons filling up all the space that have no electrons. So when you connect one end of a resistor to the (-) terminal the electrons briefly flow through it until they hit the end, and can go no further, Then current stops flowing. But now the voltage at the other end is the same as the source terminal. With the current flow stopped, there is no voltage drop across the resistor and the voltage at far end is the same as at the source end. That brief current flow I keep talking about is called [displacement current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_current).

If you use the positive terminal, think of [holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole) as the gas expanding away from the source.

&gt;I took a 41k resistor and placed it in the same circuit setup and got a 14.93V reading.

That means the total resistance of meter (assuming it is 10 megohms) and 41k is 10,041,000 Ohms. with 15 volts applied, 0.0000014938 amp flows. By V = I * 41,000 = 0.06125 drop in the 41k resistor. that subtracts from the 15 volts that the meter sees. The meter sees 14.9388. Close enough to the 14.93 you see.",1515543517
1194,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Electron hole**

In physics, chemistry, and electronic engineering, an electron hole (often simply called a hole) is the lack of an electron at a position where one could exist in an atom or atomic lattice. Since in a normal atom or crystal lattice the negative charge of the electrons is balanced by the positive charge of the atomic nuclei, the absence of an electron leaves a net positive charge at the hole's location. Holes in a metal or semiconductor crystal lattice can move through the lattice as electrons can, and act similarly to positively-charged particles. They play an important role in the operation of semiconductor devices such as transistors, diodes and integrated circuits.

It’s a nice idea and will necessarily be the first step in transitioning to an abundance economy, but it called on us to “think differently” in terms of generating all the electricity that we need locally yet I think most people already think this way, they’d love for that.  It.costs.too.much.  How will a utility pay everyone in perpetuity if every building generates more electricity than it uses?

As solar prices continue to drop, then people will necessarily power their houses and buildings with them.

They were using non-rechargable 9V batteries in the FM microphone for each actor, then discarding them each night.  They'd collected a couple hundred.

Later I discovered that old 9V alkaline batteries, sagged down to 8V, can be partially charged with a bench-supply, if the supply has a current-limit knob.   Set the current-limit to 30 or 50mA, set the voltage to 10V, then connect it to the battery (the plus wire goes to battery positive.)  An hour or two will bring the battery-voltage well above 9V.  (It won't work if the battery starts out at 8V or below.   But it works fine if they're 8.2V or higher.)   I use this to recharge all the alkaline batteries in our lab's Fluke voltmeters.

The simplest way to think of it is energy. At higher temperatures everything is more energetic, so electrons zip through the material more effectively.

At the start of the video you see a shell and tube exchanger with a head off it exposing the tubes meaning this is a condensing turbine. The exchanger cools the exhaust steam coming out of the turbine to the point that it turns back to liquid(condensate) creating a huge drop in volume(probably 100-1000x depending on inlet pressure) this creates a huge pressure differential between the pressurized steam coming in at the inlet and on the outlet. The steam must flow from nozzles, to the buckets of the rotors they are removing and to the exhaust. The goal is to transfer all this thermal energy going from high pressure steam to condensate into rotating mechanical energy.

1230,DodgeTheGround,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"A few items to clarify:

1) Is the dryer the only thing you are having trouble with?

Assumption: yes
Notes: your text seems to reflect this. It’s important to note if when the power to the dryer stops if it is confined to just the dryer or there are other items in the house that stop working at that time. 

2) Have you changed the dryer to be on its own circuit?

Assumption: yes
Notes: that is what you had the electrician do. 

3) Is the grow operation on its own circuit?

Assumption: yes
Notes: this would be how a house would be typically wired (the drier on its own circuit / wires in the wall with its own breaker in the panel box)

4) What type of bulbs is he using for his grow operation?

Typically these will be high intensity bulbs (gets hot), maybe LEDs, maybe some sort of flourescent.  Sometimes the power supplies in these devices can introduce a lot of electrical noise (harmonics) on the line that can be damaging to other equipment.  This is fairly unusual though and would only be relevant when the lights are on.  

5) Have you tested your line voltage on each of the two 120V circuits coming into your house?

Notes:  It is expected to have line voltages between 114V (maybe as low as 108V) and no higher than 126V (and definitely not higher than 128V).  An additional check is the voltage across a 240V plug (drier) it should be between 228V and 252V.  Do not attempt to take these measurements yourself if you are not comfortable with what you are doing, it is unsafe unless you are familiar with what you are doing.  

Also note: 
It would be worth checking your voltages both when the grow operation is “ON” versus “OFF”. 

6) Have you contacted your local electrical utility to check your meter for “power quality”?  

Note: Sometimes there is a persistent problem on the utility’s side of the line that goes unnoticed unless the company is made aware of it and they come install a monitoring device that takes high resolution samples of the data and analyze that data.  It’s not a terribly common problem but it does happen. 


While these questions might help home in on what the problem is, there’s not enough information given in your problem description to clearly identify the issue.  It would be unusual for the grow operation to be directly responsible for your dryer to fail to operate (unless the grow operation has demanded enough load to cause something to malfunction somewhere in your household electrical system).  

In a typical house, a regular room’s outlets might have a 15A or 20A (Ampere) 120V circuit.  That is to say it is capable of between 1600 Watts (15A) and 2100 Watts (20A) at a 0.9 power factor.   These circuits have a circuit breaker in the panel box that is designed to interrupt flow when the load exceeds that rating to prevent the wires in the wall from getting too hot and starting a fire.   A grow operation can be and usually is a pretty substantial sustained load (12h on 12h off).  If, during your initial installation of the grow operation, you kept tripping breakers that is a dead ringer that you are overloading circuits and may have damaged wiring or the breakers themselves. Further, if to fix the nuisance tripping of breakers you (inappropriately) installed a larger breaker in place of the one that kept tripping it would shift the point of failure from the breaker to the wires themselves. Now, I have no information from you suggesting you did this but I mention it because IF you did do it it is incredibly unsafe (fire) and should be addressed immediately.

1241,Firebert010,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Ah, this one's for me. Utility arborist here, my job exists because trees and parts of trees are the primary cause of storm related outages. It's a constant war we fight against the nature. 

What actually happened when your power goes out can vary greatly. Depending on where your home is situated on the circuit that supplies power to your area, the outage might affect just you or your whole neighborhood, but it's almost always a tree to blame. Outages that occur on lines which supply many customers are typically addressed with higher priority. This affects the duration of the outage.

Sometimes outages are momentary and power resumes within a few seconds. This type of outage is most closely associated with brief contact between a stick or growing vegetation and the high-voltage primary lines that carry thousands of volts. This might look like a small stick falling over the line, causing a brief fault, or a hanging wire is blown into vegetation nearby. These situations can trigger an automated protective device called a recloser that will momentarily break the circuit, then switch on again quickly. This helps because sometimes that stick will fall right off the lines to the ground and the circuit will be clear again. 

So what if your outage lasts longer? If the power doesn't come back on within a few minutes, you're probably looking at one of three situations: 

1. Something bigger fell over the lines and stayed there, causing a persistent fault and triggering the same recloser which now remains open, deenergizing the circuit. The tree part must be removed before the line can be energized again.

2. Something fell on the lines and caused a fuse to blow. Fuses are different protective devices that use a small explosive charge to break the circuit when a fault is detected. These devices must be replaced manually by a utility lineman and often isolate smaller sections of the circuit. If there's a tree down on the wire somewhere, that would have to be removed too before the fuse can be replaced. Both of these things take time. 

3. A tree fell and something actually broke. It could be a crossarm, insulator, the line itself, sometimes even a whole pole. These types of outages are often longer duration events that require both tree work and repairs from the utility.

At the end of the day, most outages are caused by what's known as phase to phase or phase to ground contact. In a three phase power distribution system, this means that some object (tree) has contacted two or more phases (wires), allowing electricity to flow between them and causing the fault. Single phase (one wire) portions of the system may also experience a fault when the high voltage primary contacts a grounded object. The goal of utility forestry is to reduce the frequency of these incidents through management of vegetation growing near equipment.",1566422915

Electrical resistivity (also known as resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is a fundamental property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the flow of electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho).

&gt; I was wondering if I should just stick with space heater to save? 

This depends on a few things. Look at the label on each heater that shows the model number. It should show the voltage and the number of amps it uses. Whichever one uses more amps is what will contribute most to the electric bill. However, there may be a trade-off. Electrical amperage directly translates to heat. The more amperage = the more heat. Thus, by throttling back or shutting off the higher amperage heater, you may be making large sacrifices in heating the space to keep you warm. You'll have to figure out where that balance is for you.

The point at the filament of bulb the EMF is higher , the electrons that are in the metal in that part get 'squeezed' and heats up/lights up. The electric field still needs to pass through though but it needs to complete the circuit.

That's because it doesn't.  

Move past actual resistors for a minute, to resistance, and to Ohm's Law.  

Ohm's law states that as current flows through a resistance, a voltage is developed *across* that resistance, and that the current flowing through the resistance, and the voltage developed across that resistance are proportional, hence the standard Ohm's Law formula.

For a given value of resistance, the higher the current flow, the greater the voltage developed.

If one now imagines an actual resistor in series with a lamp, and a battery, from [the classic diagram](https://i1.wp.com/www.free-energy-info.com/Ch12/Fig3.gif)

Because there is a resistor in series with the lamp and battery, a current will flow.  Because there is a current flowing, there will be a voltage developed across the resistor.  The voltage across the lamp will be:

V^across_the_lamp = V^battery - V^across_the_resistor

(I've used superscript as Reddit doesn't support subscript which is the traditional way of writing this)

So this is the context in which resistors are said to ""drop voltage"" - the lamp is getting less voltage than the battery provides because some of the voltage is ""dropped"" across the resistor.

So, any charges to get through end to end must give up that much potential.
The current is identical on both sides so no, it's not lower. Potential energy is lower!! Potential energy?! Watch out there, it's different than (voltage) potential.

The energy it takes to force electrons into the cloud is part of what determines the resistivity of the material. Materials with lots of ""free electrons"" are great conductors, there are lots of electrons hanging around the outer edges of the electron cloud, barely attached to any single atom.

They are extremely efficient cost wise.  
I hooked up my Kill-A-Watt monitor to determine the actual usage cost.  
On the low setting it only cost about one cent per hour to operate.  
MUCH cheaper than the oil filled radiator. I let it run for 24 hours monitored and the total cost was 25 cents. (YMWV depending on your electricity cost)

Surprisingly it keeps a 120 sq ft bedroom toasty warm on low setting  and you feel the effect of it instantly when it's pointed at you.  
Absolutely Silent, Perfect for sleeping.

I set my radiators for a minimum ~55-60 degrees and use the radiant CF only when I'm in room. Dropped my heating bill substantially.

Most heat loss in your room is probably through your windows.  
If you don't mind the loss of light, Consider a piece of styrofoam sheet cut to window size. Wrap the edges in packing tape to protect it and make it last longer.   
Then cover the window with plastic sheet and seal the edges with packing tape to control air/heat loss.  
You'd be surprised in the difference it makes.

A tunnel diode or Esaki diode is a type of semiconductor that is capable of very fast operation, well into the microwave frequency region, made possible by the use of the quantum mechanical effect called tunneling.

It was invented in August 1957 by Leo Esaki, Yuriko Kurose and Takashi Suzuki when they were working at Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, now known as Sony. In 1973 Esaki received the Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Brian Josephson, for discovering the electron tunneling effect used in these diodes. Robert Noyce independently devised the idea of a tunnel diode while working for William Shockley, but was discouraged from pursuing it.

***

**Negative resistance**

In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device's terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it.

This is in contrast to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm's law, resulting in a positive resistance. While a positive resistance consumes power from current passing through it, a negative resistance produces power. Under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal, amplifying it.

***

**Varistor**

A varistor is an electronic component with an electrical resistance that varies with the applied voltage. Also known as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic that is similar to that of a diode. In contrast to a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.

The number of electrons that left the cathode are the same number that finally lands on the anode. Meaning the same current or number of electrons per second. *BUT*, the *energy of the electrons* were lost in making the microwaves along the way. They started out at ~4000 volts and land on the anode at ~0 volts. The difference of 4000 volts times the current of ~0.25 amps is where the 1000 watts of microwave power was derived. 

Individual electrons start with 4000 [electron volts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt) and land with zero. So, since an electron volt is 1.6×10^−19 joules, and we are obtaining 1000 joules per second, we can calculate the number of electrons in flight. 4000 ev/ electron =  6.4x10^-16 joules per electron. 1000 / 6.4x10^-16 = 1.56x10^18 electrons per second in flight from the cathode to anode.",1517965375
1270,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Electronvolt**

In physics, the electronvolt (symbol eV, also written electron-volt and electron volt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately 1.6×10−19 joules (symbol J). By definition, it is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt. Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, 1 J/C) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or 1.6021766208(98)×10−19 C). Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to 1.6021766208(98)×10−19 J. Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy E = qV after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.

The electronvolt is not a SI unit, and its definition is empirical (unlike the litre, the light-year and other such non-SI units), thus its value in SI units must be obtained experimentally.

1273,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Electricity doesn't ""leak"", it always does something - usually generating heat. If you have an old fridge or something with a motor it's possible that it could be running inefficiently, thus drawing more current than normal. It could also overheat due to this and pose a fire hazard.

However it seems much more likely that you've just got a lot of people around, each with their own personal devices and whatever else they might have in their rooms. Given how vocal they are and how quick they accused you, I'd bet that they each have a few naughty high-power devices in their rooms, such as heaters, hair driers or curling/straightening irons.

The only way to prove it is to get a wattmeter - you should be able to find a plug in one on Amazon or somewhere. If you put this on your devices and measure their consumption over a couple days you'll get a good idea of average and peak draw. I think you'd be able to confirm that it wasn't you in this way, but it's unlikely you'd be able to get your housemates to do the same.

Stick to your guns though, don't let them blame you when you all have responsibility here. Hell, if anything you have less responsibility - you're there less than 50% of the time so simply can't be using the excessive amounts.",1583257278
1274,coherent-rambling,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Electricity doesn't really ""leak"" the way water can. It has to be *used* by something, or it has to travel through a short circuit.

Fortunately, you can probably back off on using flashlights instead of room lights; particularly if you've got energy-efficient CFL or LED bulbs, lights just don't consume that much power. Instead, focus on things which are either loud or hot - like I said, electricity has to be consumed in some way, and in the process of being consumed it converts into another form of energy. Generally heat, noise, or movement.

Now, ""noise"" doesn't mean your TV speakers are using a ton of power; speakers are designed to make noise and they do it pretty efficiently. But anything that makes noise as a *side* effect of its main function, gets hot, or moves is probably using a lot of power - think of things like a washer or dryer, oven/stove, microwave, refrigerator, electric water heater, hair dryer, or space heater. Those things can each use hundreds or thousands of watts. And even then, at 17 KWh/day, you're talking about an average of 700 watts. That's equivalent to running a hair dryer, microwave, or space heater for 10 hours per day, or the oven for 7 hours per day... *every day*.

By contrast, even old, inefficient incandescent light bulbs use 60 watts apiece (though this can add up fast with a lot of lights), and modern bulbs are more like 10 watts each. A cell phone charger uses 15-20 watts while charging, and a fraction of a watt in standby. A fan (ceiling fan or box fan) might use 50 watts. A desktop computer with monitor uses less than 100, and a laptop uses maybe 25. A flat-panel TV is 50-100 watts, though an old tube TV can be a lot more.

It is remotely possible for electricity to ""leak"" through a miswired circuit or a short-circuit, but in this case something would still be getting hot - a wall, switch, or outlet, perhaps. This is *extremely* unlikely to be the actual issue, though; it's incredibly rare and you'd very likely smell burning (if this does happen, call the fire department or 911 immediately, but I want to stress again how incredibly unlikely this is).

This isn't an electrical issue. This is a communication issue. The bill went up after you moved in - according to someone. Did it? Of was the previous bill paid but short $90.00 and tacked onto the next bill? You're being asked to pay the difference - show me the money. How are the bills paid? Does one person just tell everyone else what the bills are, divided by the number of tenants, with no proof? Also, if a bill such as electric or gas goes up, how is it possible to attribute the entire increase in usage to one person, just because the increase happened to coincide with your arrival? 

Many people have a program called balanced billing - it allows for the historic annual usage to be spread more evenly throughout the 12 months to allow for easier budgeting. This way, months when usage is heavier like summer, when air conditioners are used, and months when usage is lighter, are averaged so that the electric bill is more consistent. But annually, and sometimes even more frequently, the budget amount is adjusted if the usage expectations differ from the historically based prediction. 

You need to dig in and do some fact finding to really know what's going on here - and if you're not granted access to the data you need to do this- the best thing for you to do is just pay the 90 bucks and move out, into a situation where the data is transparent.",1583260610

Many electrical devices use direct current (DC) power, often provided by an AC (alternating current) to DC adapter, also known as a ""wall wart"" or ""power brick"". The adapter typically supplies power to the device through a thin electrical cord which terminates in a coaxial power connector often referred to as a ""barrel plug"" (so-named because of its cylindrical shape). The polarity of the adapter cord and plug must match the polarity of the device, meaning that the positive contact of the plug must mate with the positive contact in the receptacle, and the negative plug contact must mate with the negative receptacle contact. Since there is no standardization of these plugs, a polarity symbol is printed on the case indicating which type of plug is needed.

This produces a flow of electrons because one of the metals oxidizes (loses electrons) in the electrolyte and the electrons are gained by the other metal. This creates a flow of electrons, a negative charge, hence electricity. 

Now, when you use a battery, you are using those electrons to perform work of some kind. Say you have a battery hooked up to a light bulb, the electrons are flowing from the negative terminal of the battery into the filament of the light bulb and back into the positive terminal of the battery. The filament of the light bulb has a high resistance and will start to heat up and begin to glow, emitting light, and also (most importantly in this explanation) emitting heat. In physics, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created or destroyed. Energy can only change states. In the case of the battery and the light bulb, some of those electrons are being transformed into light and heat, thus, over time losing some of the available electrons in the battery. The more electrons a battery loses, the lower the charge of the battery, and thus, it dies. 

TL;DR: Batteries have a finite amount of electrons available to perform work of some kind. When work is performed, some of those electrons are transformed into different states of energy like heat or motion. Eventually the available electrons are used up and the battery dies.",1583642749

What happens is the chemical reaction reaches a state of equilibrium, where no further reaction can occur at the given temperature and pressure. Once the anode has given away all its spare electrons and the cathode has received all the electrons it can take there is no longer (as much of) a charge difference between the two terminals, and thus no current will flow (or not enough for the circuit to function).

Rechargeable batteries allow you to restore the charge imbalance by applying a reverse voltage higher than the battery's nominal voltage (eg 13-14V for a 12V battery). This causes electron flow back in the other direction, which restores the charge imbalance between the anode and cathode such that they have or are ready to receive spare electrons.

In fact, when electrons give off heat or light they are just moving from a high energy state to a low one - eg they are moving from a position where they are free to move to one where they are more fixed. The electrons don't ever go anywhere outside the system, they just move from one part of it to another.",1583709454
1312,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"[See my other reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/ff7aav/batteries/fjz1uch/) as the bit about electrons being transformed into energy isn't true. The electrons have energy and can give energy off, however that doesn't really happen in batteries - it's more to do with LEDs, where the electrons are excited to a high energy state by the circuit, then when they lose this energy they give off light. Also, you cannot run a filament bulb off of a DC battery, you need AC.

With a battery you have a chemical reaction occurring where electrons are released into the anode (negative terminal) and through the circuit then back into the battery at the cathode (positive terminal). Basically, when the battery is charged there are an excess of electrons at the anode and an excess of ""holes"" (places where electrons could go) on the cathode, and when you complete the circuit they try to equilibrise until all the excess electrons fill all the holes. 

They don't quite manage this, because the circuit has resistance and as electrons transfer the charge difference (voltage) between the two terminals reduces, until the current through the circuit stops it to function. When this happens the battery is said to be discharged or dead. However, some current can still flow, depending on the circuit, which is why if you leave batteries for ages all the gunk comes out.",1583710167

An ionocraft or ion-propelled aircraft (commonly known as a lifter or hexalifter) is a device that uses an electrical electrohydrodynamic (EHD) phenomenon to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.

The term ""ionocraft"" dates back to the 1960s, an era in which EHD experiments were at their peak. In its basic form, it simply consists of two parallel conductive electrodes, one in the form of a fine wire and another which may be formed out of wire grid, tubes or foil skirts with a smooth round surface. When such an arrangement is powered by high voltage (in the range of a few kilovolts), it produces thrust.

In electromagnetism, displacement current is a quantity appearing in Maxwell's equations that is defined in terms of the rate of change of electric displacement field. Displacement current has the same units as electric current, and it is a source of the magnetic field just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving charges, but a time-varying electric field. In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called dielectric polarization.

1330,bobhert1,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"At a basic level inductors are a “conjugate” or “similar but opposite” to capacitors.   Capacitors store electric charge on parallel plates and prevent instantaneous changes in voltage.   Inductors store magnetic energy in a coil and prevent instantaneous changes in current.   

In DC circuits, a series inductor can provide a filtering function, usually with a shunt capacitor, without causing much of the voltage drop you would get with a series resistor.   Also, their property of preventing instantaneous changes in current is useful in limiting inrush currents in cases where power is applied rapidly.  

Inductors are very useful in AC circuits, too, offering lots of alternatives in filters across a wide range of frequency ranges.  They’re also used in switching regulator supplies.  It turns out that if you cut the current to an inductor quickly, the stored magnetic energy continues to “push” current through, but with nowhere to go the voltage spikes really high.   Rectifying and storing those spikes allows high voltages to be generated with low input voltages.

Which is really to bad because every Electrical system is in some way a combination of capacitance and inductance.  Basically a capacitor stores electrical potential energy by storing electrical charges on two separate plates. And an inductor stores energy inside a magnetic field.

Now to answer you question about where. Inductors are used in a lot of places: motors, transformers, filters, solenoids, relays, and probably several others I didn't think about.  In DC circuits they are used in motors and filters. It's difficult to use an inductor in a DC circuit as the magnetic field collapses quickly unless the current is changing.  For a motor to work in a DC circuit it must use some form of brush to alternate the direction of current through the windings. 

To answer why: Inductors create magnetic fields which we can use to create mechanical movement (motors, solenoids, and relays) or create current in a nearby conductor (transformers).

But at the end any component will just draw the amount of current they need so even if I supply 1A, the coil won't use that much current.

I realized that I measured the résistance of the coil at 64 Ohms and the current 0.177 mA. So `64 * 0.177 = 11.3` ==&gt; meaning the coil probably needs 12V and no matter if the power supply is a 1A one. The coil would just draw `12 / 64 = 187 mA`.

MnO2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO4.

***

**Zinc–carbon battery**

A zinc–carbon battery is a dry cell primary battery that delivers about 1.5 volts of direct current from the electrochemical reaction between zinc and manganese dioxide. A carbon rod collects the current from the manganese dioxide electrode, giving the name to the cell.  A dry cell is usually made from zinc, which serves as the anode with a negative electrical polarity, while the inert carbon rod is the positive electrical pole cathode.  General-purpose batteries may use an aqueous paste of ammonium chloride as electrolyte, possibly mixed with some zinc chloride solution.

In electromagnetism, displacement current density is the quantity ∂D/∂t appearing in Maxwell's equations that is defined in terms of the rate of change of D, the electric displacement field. Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the magnetic field just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving charges, but a time-varying electric field.  In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called dielectric polarization.

1360,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The ""wire"" is nichrome wire wound inside the heating element. It is sized to have the right resistance. In your tea kettle case, 17.7 Ohms. The [line cord is copper](https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm) and would only have 0.03 Ohms for a 6 foot #14 AWG cord. So virtually all the power is dissipated in the nichrome element. By Power = I^2 X R  Only 5 watts gets dissipated in the cord. So that is why you will notice the cord getting warm, but not hot like the kettle.

Another place they use resistance to limit current is in cheap LED flashlights. They take a [3.6-4.0V LED](http://www.lc-led.com/products/810tw4d.html), run it off of three [AAA cells](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY3d6Bv9vZAhXD34MKHXajDXQQFggvMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.energizer.com%2Fpdfs%2Fe92.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OUhoT0XVRICCVIm1Q4rcG) at 4.5V, and let the internal resistance of the battery and LED limit current.

Thanks for the correction.

&gt;In a light bulb, the filament in the bulb acts as a resistance to the electrons that otherwise flow without impediment through the wire. Although the electrons can still pass through the filament, just like they pass through the wire, this requires more effort on their part. It is this work that the electrons have to do to overcome the resistance caused by the filament that generates heat that makes the filament light up.

So, filament bulbs work by using thin pieces of wire of a special material that heats up and illuminates, while LEDs excite electrons to a higher energy state and the electrons give off light (with very little heat) when they relax down to a lower energy state. Filament bulbs can be AC or DC, while LEDs are basically DC and if used in an AC circuit will only pass current on the positive wave cycle.",1584767576

Spontaneous corona discharges occur naturally in high-voltage systems unless care is taken to limit the electric field strength. A corona will occur when the strength (potential gradient) of the electric field around a conductor is high enough to form a conductive region, but not high enough to cause electrical breakdown or arcing to nearby objects. It is often seen as a bluish (or other color) glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages, and emits light by the same property as a gas discharge lamp

1371,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Ionization**

Ionization (Ionisation), is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions, often in conjunction with other chemical changes. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with light. Heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected.

**Gas-filled tube**

A gas-filled tube, also known as a discharge tube, is an arrangement of electrodes in a gas within an insulating, temperature-resistant envelope. Gas-filled tubes exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, and operate by ionizing the gas with an applied voltage sufficient to cause electrical conduction by the underlying phenomena of the Townsend discharge. A gas-discharge lamp is an electric light using a gas-filled tube; these include fluorescent lamps, metal-halide lamps, sodium-vapor lamps, and neon lights. Specialized gas-filled tubes such as krytrons, thyratrons, and ignitrons are used as switching devices in electric devices.

1374,holyslot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Short answer: In most cases, no.

When looking at the dangers of electricity in general, you need to know that the thing that kills is the current. Usually already starting from 0.2A a shock can be fatal. But when dealing with static energies, you most likely deal with more or less high voltages (up to 25-35 kV) but minimal to negligible Current. But how does this work in a human body? Well, when dealing with static energy, the human body acts as a condensator. Experiments estimate the human capacitance at 400 picofarad. Now Farad is defined by A*s/V. A*s is also Joule, so for simplicity: F = J/V. Now wikipedia states, that an Energy of 5000mJ is required for this type of electric current to be a serious health risk. Now you can calculate how much Voltage you would need for this discharge to be a potential healthrisk. So the calculation according to the above Formula would be: 4*10^-10 = 5/X. X is the needed Voltage for this equation to be true. If you solve this, you get x= 1.25*10^10 V or 12.5 GV or 12.5 billion Volt. So in comparison to the above mentioned normal static discharges at max 25-35kV (note that this is already a really high Voltage for normal static discharges) you get nowhere near the required energy for static charge to be any health risk to you. 

So is static discharge completely harmless? Not quite. Because a very commonly known type of static discharge (altough scientists are not 100% sure if it really is static discharge) is lightning. Now with lightning you suddenly are in an area where Voltage reaches Billions. So more or less the region which we calculated beforehand. So ligthning is just in the region where it CAN harm you. But the majority of people survive even this very very powerful form of static energy. Allthough most people struck by lightning suffer from some sort of injury (often even brain damage). 

So to sum up: Static Charge CAN be dangerous, but not in your everyday situations.",1584969096
1375,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt; technically possible to make this work but it’s not terribly practical and probably not worth the hassle. 

When I moved to the UK ~1982 for two years, I brought along many of my US devices. Like computer monitors and mains run turntable. I had previously built a 60Hz 900W inverter that had accurate 60Hz. I did this because I used to run things at a remote site off of gasoline generators, which have poor frequency control and many item would just not run off of anything but precise 60Hz. I typically ran the inverter off of a 30V lead acid battery bank. But when I moved to UK, I brought a large DC power supply to make the 30VDC. So In the UK I had this rube-Goldberg setup of 240V 50Hz, stepped down to 120V 50Hz, then stepped down to 30VDC, then to my inverter to get 120VAC 60Hz. I set it up in the garage and ran an extension cord into the family room to run the items. Used it for two years with no problems. But as you say ""it’s not terribly practical"". It only made sense because I already had the pieces and didn't have to buy anything new.",1559709204

If electricity refers to KWh or Joules; electromagnetic energy, then radio waves are electricity at high frequency.  We can send microwaves along a ceramic fiber, or along a single wire.  60GHz instead of 60Hz.  Technically 60GHz is ""AC.""  But a better term would be RF, radio-freq electricity.

* transformers operate at a maximum voltamperes. Meaning volts times amps. This is only watts when the load is purely resistive. For instance an induction motor looks inductive. So 230x13 = 2990VA. But this would have to be a very large transformer. Weighing about 30-40kg. generally the transformer has the maximum VA on the name plate or spec sheet.

* Short circuiting a transformer will cause a current to flow limited by the internal resistance and reactance of the transformer. This may or may not blow the fuse, depending on those values. For instance ballast transformers are purposeful built with high reactance, and will limit to a current less than the fuse if shorted.

* &gt;How would i be able to make a direct AC short on a transformer without it blowing up

* Humming can be from both.

* This is just Ohm's law.

* And specifically for variacs, the maximum input or output current is limited to the wire size used to wind the core. For instance a #14AWG winding would be limited to about 15 amps in any situation.",1521595158
1380,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Electrical ballast**

An electrical ballast is a device placed in line with the load to limit the amount of current in an electrical circuit. It may be a fixed or variable resistor.

A familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to a destructive level due to the negative differential resistance of the tube's voltage-current characteristic.

Ballasts vary greatly in complexity.

So if you want the thoery, 

Imagine your wire starting at 0 degrees on a circle. at this point it will be generating no voltage because the wire is in line the magnets natural flux lines, either side of the wire. and in phase circuit will mean that there is no current flow at this stage either. When you spin that same wire anticlockwise through those same flux lines(still in between the magnets) the wire has a voltage induced in it, assuming you have a load like a traffo onto lights then a current will also start to flow into that traffo. increasing the size of the flux lines. those flux lines interact with the second coil - your intended target voltage and your lights turn on.  Now your wire at supply genny will probably hit its peak 90 degrees and at this stage it will have worked up to a total Voltage of 325 volts {that ok traffos are designed to go above the RMS values (110 220 etc)}

so at this 325 volts at the 90 degree mark producing a change in current and your flux lines the whole time, your voltage must go down again to 0 volts however your magnetic field in your traffo is still moving so it is still inducing a current in your second coil in you traffo and therefor still producing voltage to your lights through the second winding in your traffo. 

when your supply generator wire hits the 180 degree mark its effectively back at the 0 degree mark and produces no voltage current or flux lines. After this 180 degree point, your voltage increases albeit the opposite direction again, completing out the circle having a voltage induced by the natural magnets, that makes a current which changes continuously hence, the changing magnetic field which induces a voltage and current in your second coil of your traffo and provides your lights with safe power

A Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG, RITEG) is an electrical generator that uses an array of thermocouples to convert the heat released by the decay of a suitable radioactive material into electricity by the Seebeck effect. This generator has no moving parts.

RTGs have been used as power sources in satellites, space probes, and unmanned remote facilities such as a series of lighthouses built by the former Soviet Union inside the Arctic Circle. RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred watts (or less) of power for durations too long for fuel cells, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where solar cells are not practical.

when you release the current from a coil, the magnetic field collapses back into the wire (sort of), which induces a current back into the coil itself. and that magnetic field can produce an extremely high voltage for a very short duration, which is why, in a relay for example, you normally see a diode in the reverse direction to absorb the voltage spike. as for why the MF collapses back in, idk that's just physics for you.

using that idea of the collapsing MF generating a voltage spike, you could use it to increase a voltage. these are known as Boost Circuits. you temporarily provide current to an inductor, then you remove that current and the coil produces a high voltage. that high voltage can go into a capacitor to store that high voltage. this is just simplified btw, there's a lot more to the circuit.

Whatever the reason that strip burst into flames, if it had an internal breaker it wouldn't have helped (unless the home breaker is higher value than 15A).

&gt;An adjacent surge protector can even make surge damage to nearby appliances easier.

I'm assuming you mean a surge protector so that some devices are protected leaves others vulnerable - I disagree. The way these surge protectors work is using a Metal-Oxide-Varistor - which breaks down under high voltage to temporarily short out the power lines to absorb the surge. This would also at least slightly absorb the surge from the outlet the power strip is plugged into, or at very least not make it worse.

A breaker will NEVER protect a device from a surge if that's what you're suggesting. In electronics terms breakers are extremely slow, and will only activate well after damage has been done. Breakers are to protect the wiring, not the device.

People get scared of plugging too many extension cords together - if all you're plugging in are cell phones you can daisy chain as many extension cords as you want, you'd need over 150 cell phones to go over 15A.

I buy alligator clips alone, without wires, then solder them to some nice thick #22 stranded wire.

1447,murms,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Let's talk a little bit about a theoretical battery first.

Normally a battery has \~12v of potential between its positive and negative leads. When you connect a load, that potential causes current to flow from the (+) lead to the (-) lead. (It's actually backwards from that, but we're not going to talk about that).

When you hook up a 14v charger to the battery, the charger has a higher voltage that overcomes the battery's voltage, and current flows in the opposite direction. These free electrons recombine with the battery's electrolyte to restore the active materials inside. A 14v charger produced a net voltage of 2v in the ""charge"" direction. A 24v charger would produce 12v in the ""charge direction.""

The electrolyte inside the battery is a mixture of water and sulfuric acid. When you discharge the battery, the lead / lead-oxide plates combine with the electrolyte to produce lead-sulfate and water. Charging the battery reverses this process.

In an *ideal battery, every single electron would go towards this recombination chemical process.* There would be no wasted energy, and all of the lead-sulfate would be converted back into lead-oxide.

However, in reality, batteries are not so simple. As you charge the battery, there is less lead-sulfate to convert. And so the free electrons, having nowhere to go, end up causing mischief. They break apart the water molecules, causing the battery to release hydrogen and oxygen gas, which may be vented out of the battery casing.

Making matters worse, higher current flow causes the conductors to heat up, raising the battery temperature. High temperature in localized areas can cause swelling or blistering of the battery casing, which may cause electrolyte to leak out.

Hooking up a 24v charger to a 12v battery will cause a LOT of charging current to flow into that battery. The electrolyte won't have a chance to recombine very much before the battery starts to overheat, and produces dangerous gases.",1586409543
1448,wbeaty,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower wouldn't emit any energy.  Instead it would initially fill the ionosphere with oscillating voltage, then halt.  (The oscillation would continue ringing by itself.)

Then, if someone added a distant large antenna, and tuned it to resonance, they'd absorb energy and suddenly the ionospheric oscillation would start decreasing fast.   Tesla's tower would see the decrease at its location, then start emitting energy again.

In Tesla's system, distant loads ""draw energy"" from the ionospheric fields.

But also, there's normally about a ?megawatt? of losses worldwide, even if no users are drawing any energy.  The losses in Tesla's system are constant.  This is very different than power-grids, where the losses are way higher than megawatts, but the losses drop to nearly zero if everyone in the world unplugs all their appliances.

Tesla himself explained this to critics of the time, repeatedly, yet none listened, and all kept insisting that his power system was just radio broadcasts.  Nope, it was cavity resonance, and drive-power for a lossy cavity can be calculated.

""Draw"" is the same for DC grids, AC grids, and cavity resonators such as microwave ovens:  if we sudden present a resistive load, this will cause the generator to emit extra energy to drive that resistive load (and so to maintain the local voltage, for a constant-voltage system.)",1523428969

Yet Tesla's system wasn't ""radio,"" unless you also want to label the 60Hz power grid ""radio.""  His was VLF cavity resonance, employing conductive boundaries, which differs in several major respects from any modern radio system.  E.g. system Q~=10.  Not ""unimaginable losses,"" and any signals will *pass around the earth ~ten times before being reduced by half.*  Above 100KHz, signals barely make it once around.  Up above 1MHz yes, losses would be unimaginable.  Tesla called MW, SW and shorter wavelengths by the name ""Hertzian,"" but called the high-Q cavity below 20KHz ""conductive,"" which is an accurate description for the time.

&gt; The distance station would have current induced in the antenna circuit via the EM waves present.

Only when resonant.  Non-resonant antennas have insignificant induced currents.   In the same way that a bulb ""draws"" energy from a D-cell, the resonant loads in Tesla's system ""draw"" energy from the cavity, which slightly lowers the system voltage, and causes the generator to emit energy to keep the system voltage constant.

So, to greatly reduce the chance of damage ever occurring again, I should call an electrician and have him install a ""whole house protector?"" And, from what I understand, this should be feasible without having to tear up any walls, ceilings, or floors? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but does it connect somewhere in or near the circuit breaker box?

And the ""$1 per protected appliance"" is a bit confusing. I'm not sure what you mean by this. Or ""best hardware protection."" That means the whole house protector, right?

Also, the main reason I keep my computers on is because of torrenting, dogecoin mining, web server hosting, and a home NAS.

Another thing to note is at my house I have a small metal rod inserted into the ground outside, with a wire leading to a sealed hole on the house. Does this mean I have *some* kind of earth ground?

1467,westom,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Exactly.  That third prong must connect to a completely different ground - that bus bar in the main breaker box.

Electricity is always different at both ends of a wire.  Critical is by how much and other relevant numbers.

1468,westom,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Every house must have some electrode driven in earth.  Follow a bare copper, quarter inch wire from a main breaker box.  One should connect to water pipes where those pipes enter the building.  That is only for human safety.  Other wire must route to a nearby electrode in earth.  Typically an eight or ten foot, five-eight inch, copper clad steel rod.

That (and not any protector) is surge protection.  An 'installed for free' protection for TV cable is a hardwire that also must connect direct to that electrode.  Best protection is simply a hardwire; effective if low impedance (ie less than 10 feet, no splices, no sharp bends).

Telephone also must have protection installed for free.  Telephone wires cannot connect direct to earth.  So a protector (ie inside the NID) makes that low impedance connection to same earth ground electrode.  That protector is only doing what a TV cable hardwire does better.  Like all protectors, that protector is only a connecting device to what does all protection - single point earth ground.

Only utility wires not required to have surge protection is AC electric.  A 'whole house' protector connects all three AC wires on a low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection to earth.  Protection only exists if a homeowner is proactive.

Electrician or informed homeowners can install one. These are even sold in Lowes and Home Depot.  Are provided by a long list of companies known for integrity.

Lightning is typically 20,000 amps.  So a minimal 'whole house' protector is 50,000 amps.  That critical number defines protector life expectancy over **many** surges.

Protection during **each** surge is defined by a connection to and quality of single point earth ground. How to increase protection?  Upgrade earthing by adding more rods or expanding earth ground to partially or fully encircle a building.  Anyone building a new house installs best protection when footing are poured - Ufer ground.

Electricity is always different at two ends of a wire.  That earth ground wire for human safety can be multiple tens of feet long - per code.  But that same wire is all but disconnected from earth if too long, if it has sharp bends or splices, or is inside metallic conduit.  Best is to route that wire (that will even conduct direct lightning strikes) away from all other non-grounding wires.

Any wire that would enter a structure must connect low impedance to earth ground - either directly or via a protector.  That even applies to an invisible dog fence, controllers for lawn sprinklers, and power to a detached garage.

Learn from what telcos did even over 100 years ago.  Every CO puts protectors inside a vault to make a shortest connection to earth.  The locates electronics up to 50 meters distance from those protectors.  Protection increases when that ground connection is every foot shorter.  Protection increases when separation between protector and electronics is every meter longer.

From an electrical perspective motors have two components. Stators and rotors. As the name implies Stators are the stationary outside part of the motor. Rotors are the rotating part.

In a cheap, tiny DC motor the stator is made up of several permanent magnets. The rotor is a series of coils of wire. Power enters the motor through brushes which brush up against contacts on the shaft, energizing the coil. Power in the coil causes a magnetic field to develop in the coil. The geometric arrangement of the coil and the magnets in the stator are such that the motor will want to rotate. As the motor shaft rotates the brushes lose contact with the coils briefly and then are re-contacted with the coil, however the polarity has been reversed. This causes the magnetic field inside of the coil to go the other direction, which causes the motor to continue rotating. Motors only rotate because of a changing magnetic field, and the brushes allow a magnetic field to change as the motor rotates.

In a brushless DC motor like in a computer fan the entire system has been flipped. The permanent magnet is now attached to the rotor, and the coils are located on the stator. Because no power ever enters the rotating part of the motor brushes would not allow the polarity of the coils to be reversed. Instead a control circuit is used to vary the polarity of the stator coils causing the magnetic field to move and the fan rotate.

There's another kind of motor that doesn't use brushes known as an induction motor. Almost all AC Motors are induction Motors. I believe some DC motors are also induction Motors, however they aren't really DC motors they have motor drivers that convert DC into the signal required to drive the motor.

Induction Motors don't have any permanent magnets. An alternating current is supplied to coils in the motor stator. This generates a magnetic field in the stator. Because the supply voltage is alternating in polarity continuously the magnetic field is also moving continuously. The Continuous movement of the magnetic field causes current to flow in the motor rotor coil. Current in the rotor coil results in a magnetic field pointing the opposite way. The induced magnetic field in the rotor then causes the motor to spin. There are probably YouTube videos to do a better job explaining.

If you really wanted to fix a computer fan you'd be better suited replacing the control circuit that generates the moving field. But I don't know enough about that to help you.",1587051796

The Rankine cycle is a model used to predict the performance of steam turbine systems. It was also used to study the performance of reciprocating steam engines.

It is an idealized cycle in which friction losses in each of the four components are neglected.

**Brayton cycle**

The Brayton cycle is a thermodynamic cycle named after George Brayton that describes the workings of a constant-pressure heat engine. The original Brayton engines used a piston compressor and piston expander, but more modern gas turbine engines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the Brayton cycle. Although the cycle is usually run as an open system (and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is used), it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake, enabling analysis as a closed system.

The engine cycle is named after George Brayton (1830–1892), the American engineer who developed it originally for use in piston engines, although it was originally proposed and patented by Englishman John Barber in 1791.

**Second law of thermodynamics**

The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. 

The total entropy of a system and its surroundings can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, or is undergoing a (fictive) reversible process. In all processes that occur, including spontaneous processes, the total entropy of the system and its surroundings increases and the process is irreversible in the thermodynamic sense.

1497,MY_FUCKING_USERNAME,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I'll try and answer the the 110/220V question. I'm assuming you are in N. America as most of the world uses ~220V exclusively.

So...AC power is a little whacky, so I just want you do think in terms of DC power.  Also, what I'm about to say is not going to be 'correct' and I will lie to you a bit, but it will help you understand what's happening.  This will be long winded, but will tie together in the end.

Voltage can be also described as the Potential Difference of charge between two points. Those two points, for example, could be +12v and 0v (no electrical charge)...the potential difference is 12v.  Got it?

Ok...two more points of charge could be +12v and +7v... making the potential difference between the two points 5v.

Now...power is brought into most N. America homes on 3 separate wires with 3 different amounts of charge (pretend were talking DC current here)...those wires are +120v, 0v, and -120v.

Half of your house will be connected to the 120v and 0v phase wires...all of these outlets have a potential difference (between the two prongs) of 120v.  The other half of your outlets will be connected to the 0v and -120v wires...and the potential difference between those wires is still 120 volts...the current will just flow in the opposite direction.

This is why your breaker panel has two rows (semi-lie), and why your main breaker looks like two breakers bound together... because it is breaking the both the +120v and -120v wires at the same time...two separate circuits that have the 0v wire in common.

Now...here is where that all ties together.  If you were too measure the voltage potential between the +120v and -120v wires, the potential difference is 240v.  Some devices (electric water heater, stove, clothes dryer) will get power from these two wires.

Ok...so WHY is 240v(aka 220v) more better for those devices?  Well...some devices need more power. You can get more power by either increasing the Voltage OR increasing the Current.  HOWEVER....either option has a trade-off.   If you increase the current, you have to increase the size of the wire/connections (the wire's current carrying capability)...and this is expensive.  It you don't increase the wire size, you will cause the wire to get hot.  So...to get more power, we increase the voltage instead.

Now...we can increase Voltage a little to get more power, but we can only do that so much.  The problem is that if you increase the voltage potential between two points, it is much more likely that the voltage will want to jump between the gap separating the two conductors.

It's *essentially* an instantaneous measurement (for our purposes, anyway). If you run your microwave, for instance, it might draw 1.2kW or 1,200 watts. That is how much power it is using at any given moment. The only real limitation is how large the service to your house is and how large each circuit is. One outlet might be capable of delivering 1.8kW before tripping a breaker. If you turned everything on at once you might be able to pull 12kW or 12,000 watts before tripping your main breaker. Again, this is just an instantaneous measurement and not really relevant to billing, just safety.

A *kilowatt-hour* (kWh) on the other hand IS a measurement that matters for billing. It is how utilities quantify how much power you've used. One kWh means you used 1,000 watts for one hour. If you ran that microwave (1,200 watt) for 50 minutes you would use one kilowatt-hour of electricity. Your utility would likely charge you about $0.12 for that power.

Voltage = Current x Resistance (V=I*R)


voltage is going to be constant because it's whatever your electrical company in your country sends out from the power plant, current is going to be the energy your device pulls out of the wall in order to make its components do work, and the resistance of a copper wire is pretty near to 0


Knowing this, if we re-arrange V=I*R to determine what current (I) will be, we get V/R=I, but R = 0 because it's a copper wire, so you get V/0=I. In math, anything divided by 0 = infinity, so technically the circuit you've built by putting a copper wire across your outlet plugs will consume infinity current, this is theoretical. In real life, essentially this actually means that the wire will pull more and more current infinitely until it gets too hot from carrying all that energy and melts


To combat this, electronics designers use a transformer to step down the available power from the wall outlet so a safe amount of energy is supplied to their circuit, and then they use current limiting resistors in their circuit so that there is never a shorted path (resistance = 0 so that current draw = infinity) between their power and their ground (which is when fires happen)

Anyone with half a year of basic electronics design education knows that thermal cycling is one of the biggest killers of electronic equipment from batteries to BGA solder joints to self-slagging LEDs.

And I was building missile guidance systems almost 30 years ago. What were you doing then?

&gt; Light bulb life expectancy is only determined by voltage and hours of operation.

Guess what I design now days? Lighting. And your assertion there is off because different types of lighting have different modes of operation. Induction lighting, for example, gives almost zero fucks about voltage with regards for lighting except to get the EM coils going, there is no filament or electrode to burn out. Induction lighting lasts 50+K hours without fail because of that design, with the primary mode of failure being the ballast, which usually dies from thermal cycling killing the cheap-ass mylar caps inside. LEDs are most sensitive to damage from thermal cycling, when they aren't being driven by cheap Chinese power supplies using ceramic caps which are notorious for thermal runway as they degrade, that is. They're one of the few light sources that can slag themselves. 

If light bulb expectancy were only determined by voltage and hours of operation, LEDs being at the lowest end would last the longest. Induction is good for up to 150Khours, yet its operational voltage (after the ballast) is in the 400+V range. LEDs at best (current UV/blue tech) run about 3.6V but only last roughly 30K-50K hours (depending upon THERMAL CONTROL. LEDs on a shitty dielectric board will burn out before LEDs on a solid-aluminum PCB, assuming everything else is the same.)

Just how old are you to not know these basic things we've known for over two decades?

EDIT: To boot, undervolting a halogen lamp will kill it faster because it isn't running hot enough to recombine the filament. Arc lamps disappoint every single way when undervolted, we tried that with the 7kW IMAX projector bulbs I was installing. Nope. Those are already pushing dismal efficiencies and dropping the overall voltage to them is just horrendous, down to almost incandescent levels of conversion. And those run at about 20V after striking and warm-up, yet they have just above half the lifespan of a tungsten filament bulb at 120V (500 hours for the 20V 7kW Xenon vs ~900 hours for a crappy 0.1kW 120V incandescent.)

- When you say that a device only draw as much power as they need, is equivalent to say that those devices do a determinated quantity of WORK in energy terms, and so, your energy source only deliver the quantity of energy that device need to do that work. The internal arrayment of electrical and/or electronic components depends of the nature of that device.

- In the case of the wire conected to outlets, think of that as a electrical resistance with close to infinite capacity of heat (like electrical heaters, where heat = work), so in basic hipothetically speaking terms, you also need close to infinite power (over time) supply for that heating work.

Also, A capacitor doesn't have to bulge to be bad, if the plates are touching it would be just as bad without those signs. A good way to test this would be to charge the capacitor, then remove the power source and measure the voltage in the capacitor with a multimeter.

I know more about electricity than I know about hydraulics, especially considering the fact that English is not my native language and I have rarely encountered the specific terms either in school or on the internet. Not mention that we use different units, pascal for pressure and litres for volume. 

It should be said that I've encountered the unit PSI before since I'm a bicycle rider and every thing you can find online about tires and their pressure is written by Americans. Also, I went to a professional high school (4 years instead of 3) to study Electronics...I don't like to mention it in this subreddit because it shows how inattentive and lazy I was about the ""degree"" I had chosen. To my defence, I was deeply disappointed since I wanted to create videogames and learn how computers worked, hence electronics and physics where the last subjects I intended to respect and study. Kids shouldn't choose a direction so early in life (14 years old), it's better to frequent a standard high school and decide what they like before going to university.  

I understand that Voltage is source power, Ampere is the current and Wattage is the overall power. Batteries are obviously different from components and appliances that use electricity instead of supplying it. What I think I've learned from your reply is that connecting things in series is not always better than connecting them in parallel, and the opposite is true as well. You should connect things according to the specific circuit you're building, and each connection has its own properties and advantages. 

Hence, if I have a 12V power supply, I can't connect 2 LED strips (12V each) in series because that would cut the voltage in half, and each strip would get only 6V. Assuming the strips use 5A each, and my power supply is 12V 10A, I'll have to connect the strips in parallel to get full 12V for each...Ultimately, when things are connected in series, you multiply the Voltage. When they are connected in parallel, you multiply the Amperage. 

I'm a DIY nut and I love building things, especially light fixtures for photography and filmmaking (I'm a film student). I've decided to try converting one of my LED strip fixtures into a battery powered light. I'll need a handful of batteries to build a pack that supplies 12V 5-6A, but I want to know how long will the batteries last and how can I make the battery pack more durable...?

I don't know your comfort so I'll go very high level and I'll cover the case of metals and for contrast I'll also describe a semiconductor. Now understand, all explanations are as simple as we can make them, and we need not use more complex explanations where it's unnecessary. Eg. room temp, ""human"" level voltages, etc. are all things that simplify our model and allow us to not go all the way back to the absolute basic laws of physics.

Metal...
There is the bulk (the structure) and free to move electrons. Because of reasons, these electrons flow with ease, and they are what's susceptible to electrical forces. When a machine that can push them (e.g. a battery) is applied, they move accordingly and result in you noticing a current/work being done. By analogy, the bulk is like the atmosphere, and electrons move through this environment, a la you moving on ground or in a pool, the whole thing is modelled as a simple ease of motion in the face of resistance in the given environment. This model is perfectly adequate for simple electricity. If you want current accuracy to 10 decimals maybe not, but like I prefaced, it's completely correct for our assumptions.

Semiconductors...
There is not enough free electrons to freely flow so we model them as ""moving"" through molasses, i.e. an insulator. However, when some energy is dumped into the system this changes. Now we can model them again as highly free to move. Another effect manifests in this environment though. Here there's also a need to include freely moving ""holes""/positive charges in motion in the model. It comes out of the math, they contribute enough that they need to be included (unlike in pure conductors). So in this model, after energy is dumped into the system, the bulk exists and then there exists free to move negatives and positives. Note, this is all in the context here; bulk, positive, negative, motion, these are all contextual. Now when we apply electrical forces the ""negatives"" move in one direction, ""the positives"" move in another, and the sum total is the net effect current flow. 


If this makes sense and you're curious about ""recombination"", the joining of ""neg"" and ""positive"" charges, yeah we can talk about that, but it only makes sense when one digs into the mechanics a little and explains the why electrons look like they're ""living in an environment that looks like they move through air rather than water"".",1587834794

Electricity doesn't ""know"" anything. It doesn't work like that, and it is really a lot simpler than you may think.

* electrons have a natural tendency to flow from a point of high negative charge to any point of lower negative charge. The greater this difference in charge is, the greater the ""voltage"" is. 
* when electrons find a path from high charge to a lower relative charge, they flow in the direction from high to low charge. This electron flow is called ""current"", and is measured in amperes.  One ""ampere"" is simply a certain number of electrons passing the point of measurement in one second. (When the electron charge, voltage, increases, it has more electrons, which actually makes it more **negative**. Electrons actually flow in the direction of more negative charge to less negative charge)

So, voltage is the ""pressure"" that causes electrons to flow, if there is a path. Amperes is the number of electrons flowing past a certain point in one second, because of the difference in voltage.     

I am over-simplifying this for the sake of clarity, and there is electron flow, hole flow etc etc, but all you have to understand is that current flows as a result of unbalanced voltages between two points. 

I hope this helps. Comment back if you are still unclear on this.

An arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is a circuit breaker that breaks the circuit when it detects an electric arc in the circuit it protects to prevent electrical fires. An AFCI selectively distinguishes between a harmless arc (incidental to normal operation of switches, plugs, and brushed motors), and a potentially dangerous arc (that can occur, for example, in a lamp cord which has a broken conductor).

AFCI breakers have been required for circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms by the electrical codes of Canada and the United States since the beginning of the 21st century; the U.S. National Electrical Code has required them to protect most residential outlets since 2014, and the Canadian Electrical Code has since 2015.

Arc faults are one of the leading causes for residential electrical fires.

&amp;#x200B;

**Faulty battery**

If the battery of a device is faulty, it can catch on fire during charging or use, see the problem with the Samsung Galaxy Note phones

Major companies test their products, as these failures can really hurt their reputation, but failures like this happen frequently in the drone industry, as those batteries have bigger stresses from unscheduled rapid drone landings.

*You should not be worried about this*

**Faulty charge controller**

Batteries typically do not like being ""stressed"", and damage themselves if the charge controller *inside a phone* is not working correctly

Happens very rarely, as he protection circuit is typically implemented both in the phone and inside the battery, making it really safe.

*You should not be worried about this*

**Low quality mains adapter**

Mains power bricks have access to alot of power, and faults here can cause fires or electrocution. Be careful when buying unbranded chargers. 

While branded devices typically have lots of testing done on them, they can still fail in an unsafe manner.

*If you are not cheeping out on power bricks, this is typically not an issue. Also never leave broken mains adapters plugged in, thinking it will do nothing because ""its broken""*

**Overload of power strips**

Most people do not observe that power strips come with a max power rating, or are even aware that wrapping the cord around it reduces the rating.

Overloading causes the power strip to give out more heat, and also the wire heats up

This problem is increased by the fact that power strips typically have no protections against overloads when you plug to many devices in.

*Always properly respect the power rating of power strips, and remember that routing a large part of the cable though sound insulating foam traps heat. Some people even go as far as saying to never daisy chain strips together. Some expansive power strips also come with build in thermal fuses that trip if they overheat, but this is typically not needed if you observe its rated power.*

**Arch faults**

Metal expands and contract under the influence temperature. This is typically not a problem, but it can become one if the connection between 2 metal parts is just about to disconnect.

If the metals are close enough, an arc will form between the 2 parts, causing a lot of heat centralized into that spot. If this spot is near flammable objects it can cause fires.

I have read fire investigations that blamed this happening inside a vacuum cleaner as the cause of a fire.

*There are circuit breakers specialized to catch these faults, and these faults can strike at any moment. This is why circuit conduits are typically made from fire stopping materials. Avoid wrapping mains electric cords very tight, and replace sockets if the connection is very poor.*

**Space heaters**

Where do I even start with these things...

*Never leave them unattended (expect the permanently installed ones), never put them near flammable materials, never cover the air intake flame if they have one, avoid plugging them into power strips (as they typically overload the power strips), don't bypass the safety*

**Illegal breaker replacement**

Don't just replace a 15A breaker with a 30A breaker in your electricity distribution box, because it keeps tripping 10 minutes after you started all your equipment. It trips because you are slightly overloading it, and allowing up-sizing the breaker without replacing all the wires makes the wires the weakest point",1588458209

A galvanic cell, or voltaic cell, named after Luigi Galvani, or Alessandro Volta respectively, is an electrochemical cell that derives electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions taking place within the cell. It generally consists of two different metals connected by a salt bridge, or individual half-cells separated by a porous membrane.

Volta was the inventor of the voltaic pile, the first electrical battery. In common usage, the word ""battery"" has come to include a single galvanic cell, but a battery properly consists of multiple cells.

I'm guessing by AC and surge suppressor, you mean you have either a wall mounted/window/free standing A/C unit, and that you're plugging it into a power strip/surge suppressor?

If it is what I think it is, two things:  1\) your A/C is drawing more amperage than your surge suppressor is capable of providing, and it trips.  2\) From the picture, the melted plug could be either a symptom of #1, or it's an old A/C unit and it's starting to draw more amperage that IT was originally rated for and it's tripping the surge suppressor for that reason.

Either way, DO NOT use a surge suppressor with any high\-amp appliance; A/C, plug in heaters, etc, unless it was specifically rated for more than the amperage that your appliance is supposed to draw.  For example, if your A/C unit draws 15A, make sure your surge suppressor is rated for at least 20A and is plugged into a wall outlet that is connected to a 20A breaker on the house.  If you plug your A/C straight into the wall, make sure that that the breaker on that wall outlet is rated to handle the amperage of the A/C or higher.

That burned plug is scary because nothing yet says why that one prong burned (and the other carrying same current did not).

What would say so much more is a Kill-A-Watt.  That maybe $20 tool would answer plenty of questions that need numerical answers.  And also teach relevant facts for other appliances and electricity.  Kill-A-Watt is a powerful tool.

Power strip had a circuit breaker and melted?  Melted where?  Where a power cord plug was connected?  Maybe the receptacle was not firm - explaining an AC's burned prong.

A loose receptacles often is not obvious with a three prong plug but is very obvious with a two prong plug (ie lamp cord).

Also a concern is that failed household wiring.  In many cases, that may be a wire connected to its receptacle using the back stab method.  Safe for humans; but bad for appliances.  Learning what in household wiring failed should also be learned.

It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state.

Everyday manufactured electricity seeks ground only because we reference the system to ground. The alternating current coming from a generator doesn't really want to ground out - it's because we take 1 pole and we ground it at the generator and run that conductor along with the others to their destinations as ""hot"" wires and the grounded conductor, grounded at multiple points along the route, is the ""safe"" conductor because we artificially made that conductor's potential the same as the earth's potential, and call that ""0."" This is why the hot conductors (on a 3-phase system) have a potential to ground and seek ground - if they're 120 volts potential they want to complete the circuit. But there's actually 208 volts potential between any 2 of the 3 phase conductors so they'd really like to seek a different phase rather than ground.

But... if we do not ground a system - say we take a simple generator and there's 120 volt potential between neutral and hot - and we do not ground it. The the power wants to flow only from one conductor to the other, and neither conductor to earth would establish or complete a circuit and then electricity does not ""seek ground"" at all. 

A tazer doesn't seek ground either - the shock is between the 2 conductors only - grounding it would do nothing because it has no reference to ground and current from one probe can't get to the other probe through the ground by any means. All the carbon would do is provide a low resistance path from one probe to the other if both were penetrating the carbon, similar to putting a piece of foil between the terminals of a 9 volt battery. 

Foil would work too but sandwiched into the material a shirt is made of it wouldn't last and couldn't breathe.

It's easy to overload an extension lead with too many devices plugged in so you're probably better off having it plugged in on its own.

With transformers and energy converters the issue is probably that they would likely not be rated high enough for the shredder.

Provided you haven't got too much else plugged in it shouldn't be an issue.

1644,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It's confusing as current, voltage and resistance are all inter-related thanks to Ohm's law. To really measure these things you should be looking at Watts or even VA (apparent power), this tells you the burden at any voltage, whereas for things like headphones the voltage is fixed by standards so they just use the impedance.

The micro-controller will only be able to put out current up to a fixed amount at 5V. By stepping this up to 12V you will lose a significant amount of current, not just due to losses but because 1A at 5V is less than 0.5A at 12V - the change in current is roughly proportional to the change in voltage. Your micro-controller is probably putting out even less than that at 5V, and almost nothing at 12V.

If you connected up the solenoid to a source of any voltage the impedance of the solenoid wire would determine the current, by Ohm's law. Impedance includes both resistance and reactance, however the reactive part is only there during the transient when switching - at DC it is just resistance. There's also the resistance of the wires feeding into and out of the coil, as they may be a much more comparable resistance than with traditional loads, however typically the solenoid will be designed and rated to take that into account.

You don't really need to know the minimum current to turn it on, as typically any device rated for supplying 12V would be more than capable. Your microcontroller will only be putting out a small fraction of an amp at less than half the voltage - this is useful for small switching operations but not moving a big solenoid.

As u/acme_mail_order said you could use the microcontroller to operate an interposing relay, which then switches a proper 12V supply onto the coil.

1646,tminus7700,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"While the other explanations involving analog meters is correct.

The typical DVM (Digital Volt Meter) uses a circuit called a [Dual Slope Integrator](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1041). The meter starts by charging (Integrating) a capacitor to the input voltage. 

&gt;A dual-slope ADC (DS-ADC) integrates an unknown input voltage (VIN) for a fixed amount of time (TINT), then ""de-integrates"" (TDEINT) using a known reference voltage (VREF) for a variable amount of time (see Figure 2).

&gt;The key advantage of this architecture over the single-slope is that the final conversion result is insensitive to errors in the component values. That is, any error introduced by a component value during the integrate cycle will be cancelled out during the de-integrate phase. In equation form:

&gt;Vin × TINT = VREF × TDEINT

or

&gt;TDEINT = TINT × (VIN / VREF)

The de-integrate time is now proportional to the original input voltage and is scale as voltage on the display. You will note that this scheme can have extremely high input impedance's.  But typical DVM's set it to 10 MegOhms. In essence the DVM is just comparing the unknown voltage to a known reference voltage.

In addition there are what are call [electrostatic voltmeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_voltmeter), in which they measure the coulombic force between two plates. These have theoretically infinite input resistance. Since you need a fairly large force, these generally are only used to measure voltages of a few hundred or higher.

There are many ways a meter can be designed to measure volts. You simply need a physics phenomenon where you can have an equation where voltage is proportional to some physical result of that voltage.",1528770129

And yes, at higher voltages will generally see a lower turn on current. Like I say, the real measurement is VA, which is Volts x Amps and thus can be converted to your system voltage.

After amplifying the voltage to go back to the circuit of the spark gap, this circuit will increase the frequency along with the surge voltage. Typical for this event is the spark gap circuit of the Tesla coil.

The problem facing now is high voltage and high frequency in two forms:

1. Normal ""electricity""
2. ""Radiated electricity"" or ""Cold electricity""

When the frequency is too high, and strictly adhered to, the circuit with a spark gap will create an ""Cold electricity"". This is the type of electricity found in Tesla coils when strictly observed. With this type of electricity, it only has high voltage, without normal electric current. However, it still makes light bulbs and transmit electricity without wires.

When the frequency is not too high, we have the usual crazy and associated with a little ""Cold electricity"".

Therefore, both cases cause abnormal electrical circuits.

All measuring tools, along with ordinary equations, cannot discover this type of electricity. Because it is the Radiant Energy that Tesla developed (later suppressed).

If we use spark gap to increase voltage and frequency, it will be very problematic for transmission and use for electric equipment which are motor operating at low frequency (e.g. motor sync for example).

The 63V 0.22F capacitor has an energy capacity of more than 10 times the 2.5V capacitor, and the higher voltage would be far more useful to you. Although the 2.5V caps may have a high short circuit current, the voltage is likely too low to discharge a significant current through almost any circuit. In any case, you should probably consider your 2.5V capacitors mostly useless, and they will not be suitable for your applications.

If you want 400V with a high output current, rather than converting the voltage to 400 volts from the output of the capacitor, consider putting 7 of the 63V capacitors in series and then charging the bank to 400V. The capacitor bank will have the specs  You can buy chargers off ebay that can convert 12V DC to 400V.

And that is only about safety ground.  Another ground also must exist.  And can never be reported by that meter, three prong tester, or power strip.

Visual inspection (of both grounds) are required.  For example, remove the cover plate.  Does a bare copper wire physically connect to that grounding screw?  Same inside a breaker box.  Does that same safety ground wire connect to a bus bar inside that box?

The time-clock could vary greatly in size and location, but it would generally be in a rectangular metal case either about 4""X8"" for a 24hr unit or a larger case for a 7-day unit.

Identify the breaker that controls the lighting, then open the panel and observe where the sire goes from that breaker. You may find that it pipes over to a nearby metal box that houses the timeclock.

So, a touch lamp uses very small voltage changes to detect when you touch the surface of the lamp. These voltage changes are deliberately small to avoid shocking you when the lamp is plugged in, but enough it can detect the change your touch has on it.

When you turn on a motor, you have inrush current because, for a brief moment, the coils inside are a dead short to ground. As the motor energizes, these coils magnetize and form impedance. 

What I suspect happened was they feed the same circuit to your fan and the outlet where you have the lamp. When you turn on the switch for the fan, it draws all the current for that circuit, and that affects the lamp. To prove it, move the lamp across the house, and it won't change. It could also be a bad ground connection where some of the voltage meant to go down the neutral winds up on the ground and that can cause issues.

The way electricity works is that electrons want to get from a place of high potential (voltage) to a lower one, similar to how a ball held in the air will fall when dropped. The number of electrons is it's charge, and how fast they flow is amperage. The resistance is what impedes that flow.

All electrical systems have a ground, or point of lowest electrical potential. The earth itself is the largest ground there is, hence the name. However, just because it is the lowest electrical potential, does not automatically mean that all electricity winds up getting there.

Your body has inherent resistance, just like everything including electrical wires. This resistance is what keeps the electricity from flowing along the surface of your skin to ground, though if there is enough, then your skin isn't going to be enough to stop electricity from making it, leading to injury or death.

If the pipe you are touching is stuck into the ground, then yes, there is potential to make the jump from wires to the ground through you. Most electricians shut of power before working on electrical systems for this reason. Some systems, however, cannot be shut down, and require Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE. This can protect you to a point, but some equipment is just too dangerous to work on with live parts.

My recommendation is to shut off the power before doing any work. If you are uncertain conditions are safe, do not work on it.",1530400114

Nooo?

Systems fed from an isolated supply do not have a 'ground' (or if they do, it's completely electrically separate from the actual supply conductors). In a single phase isolating supply, all conductors are equal and have no fault current to earth ground.

Potential (voltage) is *between* two points. For example, telecom systems often use negative 48V - a lower-than-ground potential. 

Alternatively, ground can simply mean 'a common point that everything else is referenced to'. This is common in situations where you do not have access to an actual earth ground, for example in battery powered applications.

But for general mains-powered work, yes, touching an active/phase/hot conductor and ground, or anything electrically connected to ground, can shock you.

1723,matterny,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I would think more about climate control and cooking then computer power usage. Let's assume that both computers have a total load of 1kwh (600w power supply plus 400w monitor), so every day you'll use 12 kwh of electricity across all your computers, assuming they are really on for 12 hours a day. (My numbers are a little high, but probably close enough for this). This means if you use your computers for 30 days, at 12 kwh per day, the computers would use 360 kwh alone. 

However, I'd guess that if you built your system properly, your pulling closer to 400 watts for the computer peak (plus monitor), and realistically, the computer is probably netting just about 500w, including monitor, when not gaming. (More load means more power). 

If you've noticed from my numbers, worst case scenario your using a third of your power for computers, assuming your somehow keeping the systems under max load. Realistically, we would need to know what your other appliances are expecting to use for power, like the coffee maker, the stove/oven, and the fridge, in order to properly inform you. 

Edit: I'm aware you said the power supply was a little higher than I estimated, but none of your components stand out to me as needing more than a 600w supply, so I would argue my numbers are probably accurate for this situation. ",1531373271

Magnetostriction (cf. electrostriction) is a property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetization. The variation of materials' magnetization due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value, λ. The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule when observing a sample of iron.

&gt;as opposed to typical transformers that transferred the energy immediately to the secondary.

Is what they do in [forward converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_converter). The main difference in these modes is that in a forward converter the energy is transfered from primary to secondary by the changing magnetic field, as the field is induced in the core. 

Like everything in engineering there are trade offs between the two. In flyback converters the energy is first built up in the core, THEN transferred to the secondary by the now collapsing magnetic field. The forward converter only needs about half the core material of a flyback. A flyback is a little simpler design (but more complicated math).",1532034453
1741,WikiTextBot,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**Forward converter**

The forward converter is a DC/DC converter that uses a transformer to increase or decrease the output voltage (depending on the transformer ratio) and provide galvanic isolation for the load. With multiple output windings, it is possible to provide both higher and lower voltage outputs simultaneously.

While it looks superficially like a flyback converter, it operates in a fundamentally different way, and is generally more energy efficient. A flyback converter stores energy in the magnetic field in the inductor air gap during the time the converter switching element (transistor) is conducting.

1742,2hu4u,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt;What is the risk of a synthesizer catching fire while it is on?

Zero. As far as I can tell, there's no record of a musical synthesizer ever catching fire in the history of the world due to its electronics. Musical synthesizers generally **do not** contain flammable material (such as lithium batteries), and are low voltage low power devices. This limits the amount of heat that can be generated in its electronics - I would go as far as saying it is possibly the safest device in your house. 

Most electronics are designed by competent engineers who calculate the maximum amount of heat that can be generated in each component, and then make sure the parts are adequately chosen to not pose any hazard. 

The only synth-related incident I can find by googling is capacitors malfunctioning in very old models (this causes ""smoke"", but it is not a fire and there is no risk of ignition). You would have to put in considerable effort even to *force* one to catch fire! Putting it simply, you are more likely to be hit by lightning on your way to winning the lottery.

&gt;Are there no risk at all after electricity is not passing through?

Correct. It is 100% impossible if it is turned off. 

&gt;Can it be the some components overheat and catch fire after the machines have been turned off?

No. Heat generated by electricity requires electricity.

1744,Some1-Somewhere,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"In general, the supply of electricity exactly matches the demand each second. Batteries are not usually cost-effective at the sizes needed for electricity grids - this is changing, but slowly. So for there to still be lights on, anywhere that does not have a backup generator and weeks/months of fuel, you need the grid and some power stations to be running.

Note that not all power plants require staffing. Many hydro-electric plants are unstaffed except for maintenance, and wind is the same.

If the load is reduced so these plants produce enough power on their own to run everything connected to the grid, the grid might continue operating indefinitely until there is severe equipment failure. 

For example, industrial processes are likely to trip safeties and shut down if there is no staff, or staff will shut them down manually before leaving.

Residential and commercial will vary, and this is what will likely be the deciding factor.

What does likely need to be staffed, at least initially, is the grid operator - they ask each power plant to start up and shut down as necessary to maintain the balance over longer periods. They also often have the ability to cut power to large consumers or certain areas.  They will need to shed load faster than generation goes offline, and get the load constant enough enough that the automatic governors can handle the load changes.

Some load shedding will happen automatically if the grid goes out of limits - you will likely find some suburbs or cities get cut. However, if the load changes are too large and too fast, the automated systems may not handle it, and it's possible generators and transmission lines will start tripping. If this happens, it's likely that the whole grid will fall over.",1591006615
1745,acme_mail_order,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"*(Sweeping generalizations ahead. Nit-pickers may wish to avert their eyes)*

Electricity cannot be stored. It can be converted into other forms of energy and then converted back to electricity when needed. On a small scale, this is how a rechargeable battery works.

The vast majority of the power we use is generated on demand. Power plants do not require constant attention and plenty of them are completely unmanned - this is most common in the smaller hydroelectric stations. The systems in a hydroelectric station are extremely simple and a worst-case failure mode means it just stops generating electricity. Same with wind turbines - no one is sitting up there minding the thing. Any of those could run for months without any supervision. The power grid that delivers the power is similarly heavily automated.

A thermal power plant (burns things to make steam) will run until whatever it burns runs out. This could be a matter of days for coal, indefinite for gas that comes in via a pipeline.

Nuclear power tends to have a rather high penalty for failure - the staff are there in case something goes wrong. Hopefully one of them pushed the Big Red Button before leaving.

But of course these will only last as long as there is fuel, and usually a few hours worth of fuel is kept ready at all times. The idea is that the mains can die out and hopefully be restored in a few hours, the generators can provide uniterupted electrical power during that time so that (e.g. in a hospital) life support systems don't shut down, and if power can't be restored in a reasonable amount of time, there is still time to move people who need life support to another hospital.",1591014579

1748,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"1.5V would do nothing, as without a change in voltage there is no changing magnetic field, and thus no mutual inductance. A high enough voltage, however, would damage the insulation around the windings, causing a short between the primary and secondary and possibly an explosion. The voltage would need to be quite high, likely higher than the rated AC voltage but perhaps this would depend on the type of insulation.

This test is still done though, it's the main commissioning test of a transformer before right you energise it (the serious testing, eg short circuit, is done at the factory before it's shipped to site). It's known as insulation resistance or Megger testing (although Megger, the test equipment manufacturer, would rather people didn't use their brand as a verb) and you apply a DC voltage of usually up to 5kV across primary to earth, primary to earth with secondary earthed and secondary to earth. The device then measures the current that flows and gives you a resistance, for a transformer you'd probably expect 10s to 100s of Gigohms. The exact voltage level to test at depends on the voltage rating for the transformer (primary and secondary can have different test voltages) and is specified by the manufacturer.

In your example, you're applying 1.5V DC on the 2kV secondary side of the transformer. That voltage is probably fine, as an example when we commissioned a 33:0.400kV transformer we tested with 5kV on the 33kV side but 2.5kV on the 400V (230V phase to neutral) side. Although I will say, you don't really want to fuck around inside a microwave, there are components in there that store a lot of charge and could easily kill you if you touched them, even with an insulated tool.",1568756179

1758,MrJingleJangle,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"As others have noted, power is generated and used in real time.

The grid is maintained at a nominal frequency 50Hz or 60Hz, depending on where you live, and the tolerance for the frequency is very tight.  The *system operators* maintain that frequency, and schedule generation as required to match the generation to ensure there uis enough generation to ensure that frequency can be maintained, with enough generation available in case of some failure, called *spinning reserve*.

Now if no-one were to look after this, and it were left on autopilot, how long could it run for?  With the entire nation dead or zombiefied, I'd say not very long.  With the nation dead, people would stop doing things quite quickly, factories would start to break down, and so the load would start to reduce, and the grid frequency would start to rise.  Grids are much better at handling under-frequency than over-frequency; you can't just add load to solve the problem.

As the frequency rises, very soon generation stations will drop off-line to protect themselves.  Generation stations with rotary turbines, which are almost all generation stations, can only operate within a very narrow range of RPM, or they self-destruct.  Which is why they drop off-line if they risk going out of their very narrow safe RPM range.

So stations dropping off-line solves the over-frequency problem, as the generation better matches the load, but very soon, the transmission will become unbalanced, as electricity is flowing around the network in ways it is not configured for, and will overload the network in some places and underload it in others.  Because some places are overloaded, those circuits will trip out, so some parts of the grid will lose power.  With the grid now fragmented, with some cities in darkness, those remaining parts of the grid will either be in over-frequency, and the cycle there will repeat, or in under-frequency, and they will have a classical cascading blackout.

1759,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Voltage is a measure of energy difference between two points - in fact another name for it is Potential Difference - so it is analogous to pressure in that pressure ""pushes"" things from high pressure to low pressure.

Current is the flow of energy between two points. 1A = 1C/1s where C = Coulomb and is the unit of electric charge. If you apply a voltage across a load it will have a current proportional to the voltage and its resistance (V = I x R, or I = V / R). You don't really ""push"" current to a device though, in that you can't push more current through it under normal conditions. It just takes what it can for a given voltage level.

With a power supply rating, you need one with the correct voltage output rating and one with a current rating that **exceeds** the current you're looking to draw. If you're looking to supply 3A, a 12V 6A supply would be perfect.

Resistance does not control the voltage. Resistance is a property of all things and is just a measure of its ability to allow current to flow. If anything, resistance controls current, but I don't think that's a great analogy.

LEDs are diodes, like you say. A diode's main property is that it only allows current to flow in one direction, if you apply a voltage in the wrong direction you will get almost no current until you reach the reverse breakdown voltage, where the diode will fail and the current will rise sharply with higher voltage. For most diodes this failure is permanent and fatal to the device. When you apply a forward voltage (or bias, as the common term here) then nothing will happen at first until you reach the turn on voltage. This because a certain voltage is needed to polarise the semiconductor enough to allow current to flow. This is typically around 0.7V for silicon diodes. Above this voltage the current will rise steadily with increasing voltage. Be wary of graphs you see that illustrate the forward and reverse bias, often the scales on either side are different and they don't really show the gradients right.",1568758700

3 computers at 300W = 900W. Since you only have the 1 refrigerator and 1 microwave, we add those: 900W + 200W + 800W = 1900W. So the worst case would be 1900W all at once.

Now, if the teacher asked for total power consumption, you'd measure in Watt-hours. The 3 computers would be 900W \* 7 hours = 6,300 Wh. The refrigerator would be 200W \* 24 hours = 4,800 Wh.

To use the ever-popular water-pressure analogy: imagine you have a pump (battery) connected to a ball-valve (resistive load), which connects to a hose that runs right back around into the pump input. If the valve is closed, and the pump output is blocked (no water flow = no current) the pressure (voltage) measured across the pump will be as high as the pump can manage. Now imagine you just slightly crack open the valve(a light load, low current). Your pump will be able to basically keep as much pressure as when it was fully closed, so the pressure (voltage) is the same under a light load. Now you fully open the valve, so there is no restriction at all. The pump is pushing water as fast as it can through the hose, but there will be very little pressure measured across the pump, because the valve does not provide enough resistance to allow the pump to generate pressure. The pump is only able to move so much water, and if the spigot doesn't ""push back"" on the water, no (or very low) pressure will be generated by the pump.

Batteries are much like a pump, they're physical devices with limitations. They can only supply so much current before the physical chemical reactions inside of them that are generating the electricity are unable to keep up. Other power-supply devices are the same way, generators, power supplies, etc. They all have limitations to what they can do. ",1533574872

* Take a 25 foot hose, connect it to the sprig. Notice how much water pressure there is. Now connect a 200 foot hose. Notice how the water pressure far smaller. **The water is barely coming out compared to the shorter hose. This is because the pressure drops over a great distance.**

The same is true with electricity. **Over a long distance, the electricity gets restricted, and has a hard time keeping up the electrical pressure**. The voltage pressure going through the wire begins to drop, as more and more resistance is given to the circuit.

* **If you put a kink in that hose, the pressure will also drop.**

This is true with wiring. **If you make a poor connection, that is a kink in the wire.** That poor connection is resistance, like the kink resisting the water flow. So a bad wire connection drops voltage

* Now open the back of your toilet, the tank. Now flush. **See how the water in the back drops down quickly out of the tank?** That is because the amount of water require to complete the flush, was larger that the amount of water available.

TL:DR. 
Your confusing voltage and current and the roles they play in a system.

voltage in an off itself doesn't go anywhere or do anything. 
But it is the object of OPS post, voltage or potential difference, is an increased amount of electrons around an atom but the atom itself doesn't go anywhere 

Current on the other hand, Is the movement of electrons from one conductor to another. 

resistances regulate currant, usually to varying levels of success, depending on the voltage its been designed to withstand. 

You can add multiple loads to this system, kettles, pcs, bulbs, people! and they will all take SOME electrons but an atom itself, or an ion for that matter, never moves from its position inside of its material

I've made an explanation of the differences below

_
_





This is the theory hopefully if theTL:DR above doesn't help this might. 
_


The amount of electrons that each atoms posses in the live wire isn't an indication of how many electrons are flowing. 
or even that electrons are flowing. It is an indication of the voltage only. And these atoms are called ions.
(artificial atoms, produced by humans.) 

Voltage is created at a generater

 AC production is electromagnetic, we take a wire and spin it around inside of a pair of magnets really f*cking quickly. This is a generator. 


 two magnets have the effect of inducing another magnetic effect, rotating anticlockwise, around that material and also pushing electrons out of their orbits(orbits inside atoms) . 

When this wire starts spinning the electromagnetic effects starts collecting all of the electrons inside the magnets field of influence and pushing them into the live side of the system (for simplicity sake). More electrons on the neutral side fill the gaps and get pushed etc. 

So now we have a live and neutral wire.  230 volts worth of 30 electron (artificial atoms =ions) on the live side. With a lack of electrons in the neutral wire at 0 volts 28 electrons. 

Now your potential difference(voltage) is 230 volts full of ionised copper atom/material/any conductive thing. 

Now when you position a load between these wires, (it can not just be another copper wire) it has to be something with some substance like tungsten, a bulb!. These ""live"" ions try to shed this extra electron and so we get SOME of the electrons passing through this path into the neutral wire, where they make their way back to the generator, 

This is the path of current your talking about and there are many ways this path is completed, but it must be completed with a material of resistance to prevent a short. A very dangerous situation where you create alot of heat very quickly/potential fire. 


unfortunately alot of times some People create this path themselves by making contact with exposed conductive parts. People are made of water so they are more conductive than copper and this can result in a dangerous current flow. 
 That is how people electrocute themselves but it IS completing a circuit, and will allow current to flow through you. 

You can add multiple loads to this system, kettles, pcs, bulbs, people! and they will all take SOME electrons but an atom itself, or an ion for that matter, never moves from its position inside of its material

1803,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"For you to get shocked your body needs to complete a circuit. As the transformer feeding your house has an earthed neutral, as soon as you touch a live wire you will complete a circuit, running from the transformer live, through you, then the ground and back to the neutral/earth point on the transformer.

Do not touch a live 110V AC wire. Even the neutral might not be at the same potential as the ground near you, meaning you can get a shock. You can't tell if a conductor is safe by looking at it, you need a proper proving device that makes 2 points of contact. They're easy to find, more expensive than the little pens but they actually work (edit: admittedly with HV you use things similar to the pens, but then with HV there's a bit more energy so it's a bit different. Plus I'm pretty sure if you touch live HV with them they're basically spent).

You can get unearthed systems (called an IT system) which won't cause a fault current with a single failure to ground. These are used where it's essential that the supply must remain on, and they use active monitoring to detect earth faults. However, if no one responds to the 1st fault, as soon as a 2nd connection is made to ground the fault path is established, and the fault current is much larger in these systems.

This circuit is likely to discharge the battery to a certain capacity (Likely &lt;10%) and maintain that charge level on the battery. You really would want around 15 volts to charge this battery.

The watt rating can be used to calculate how long it will take the solar panel to charge the battery.",1591736535
1818,NoRoomForEmpire,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Using water as the analogy:

Volts is electrical pressure, like water pressure. 

Amps is electrons per second, like gallons/liters of flow per second.

Ohms is a measure of the amount of resistance to the flow of electrons, or water. 

Watts is a measure of the total amount of energy being used/transfered. ""How fast and at what pressure."" (watts = volts x amps) 

The voltage rating of the motor is the amount of electrical ""pressure"" that is required to turn the motor. Too low and it won't turn, too high and it may burn up. 

The amperage rating of the battery is the max amount of electron flow that the battery can produce. If your motor demands more electrons per second than the battery can produce,  performance will diminish and the battery could be dammaged.

Amp-hours is a measure of battery life. A 2Ah battery will produce 2 amps for 1 hour, 1 amp for 2 hours, 4 amps for 0.5 hours, etc. amphours = amps x hours.

As far as a solar panel, find the battery you will be using first. I would recommend getting a combo panel &amp; charge controller. Make sure to get one that can match the Votage of the battery.",1591736560

How nice is your boat?  Does it already have a battery?  You shouldn't put the trolling motor on the same battery (though you probably can) because you could end up stuck on the lake with a dead battery because you were trolling all day.

Anyway, if you already have a boat battery and your motor has an alternator that charges the boat battery you might just want an automatic charge relay that will connect the trolling motor battery to the alternator so that it also charges when the boat is running but disconnects it so that it won't discharge the boat battery when you are trolling.

1820,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"People have given some pretty decent definitions, here's my take:

First, you didn't ask, but there are two types of electrical system: AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current).

AC is what comes out of the plug at home. It's probably either 110V or 230V (give or take), or maybe your house has both depending on where you are. In an AC system, the voltage and current are constantly changing, from 0, to peak, to zero, to negative peak, to zero; over and over again. The 110V or 230V isn't the peak, it's the ""RMS"", which is (*very* basically) an average. The peak voltage on a 230V system is about 274V.

DC is what things like phones and computers use (you might plug them into the wall, but the thing you plug in converts AC to DC). DC voltages and currents are fixed, so 12V DC will always be 12V at the positive terminal and 0V at the negative. Note: 0V is relative, and 0V AC is not the same as 0V DC - in fact AC and DC systems are separated at the charger.

All batteries are DC, so your boat will be DC.

Voltage - this is (very basically) the system energy level. With voltage ratings, things are designed so that the insulation (be it plastic, rubber, air or whatever) is thick enough that you won't make a short circuit between the different voltages you're trying to separate (eg 12V and 0V DC). The rating tells you the maximum voltage it can take, and whether it's AC or DC (AC has curly lines, DC is straight - but look up the symbols).

Amps is current, which is energy moving due to electric charge. Voltage is the energy levels, Current is the rate the energy moves and Resistance is a property of the material which determines how much current flows. Ohm's law is given as V = I x R, and this is always true. When two things are said to be insulated, R is very big, so I must be very small (next to zero) for any given voltage.

Battery amperage is the maximum current they can put out. A device may need a certain minimum current to function, if the battery cannot provide this current it won't work.

Amp-hours is a measure of battery charge, or energy consumption. It is literally Amps x hours, and tells you how long a battery will last.

Watts - a measure of power. Power P = V x I, for AC (single phase only, but you will probably only see single phase) and DC. It's an indication of how ""strong"" a device is. A 3,000W heater will heat up quicker and get hotter than a 1,500W heater.

In summary what you need to match:

* Voltage - you need to make sure you have the correct voltage - as close to exactly matching as possible. If you try and run a 12V device at 15V you might damage it, if you run it at 8V it won't work. So you want the voltage of your battery to be the same as your device rating.

* Current - your battery must be able to provide at least as much current as you need. Preferably more. So you want the battery output current to be more than the device rated current.

* Amp-hours - take this battery rating then divide it by the device current rating. This will tell you roughly how many hours the battery will last from a full charge before it needs recharging.

* Solar panel - you want a solar panel or charging system that's rated for the battery you're using. This means the voltage, but also the type of battery (eg Lithium ion, NiMH, etc). The type of battery refers to the chemicals inside of it.",1591751204

**What does it mean that this motor is rated for a given voltage? **How much Volts does the motor need to work the best or work at all. To a 12V motor you pair a 12V battery.  
**What are amps? **Current, sign: A. How much electricity actually moves in the electric circuit. The circuit itself will have a certain resistance (Sign: Ohm or Ω) (more stuff = more resistance) and the amperage of the circuit will depend on that.

&gt;What is going on there is that the current flow is from what is called displacement current. This current only flows when the electric field is changing. So it only flows when you first connect to a DC line, then stops. But flows continuously when you connect to an AC line. Since the electric field is always changing (alternating) on AC lines. 

For something the size of a human and those same &gt; 100KV lines, that current could kill you.

Edit: I calculated the displacement current from touching a 200,000 VAC line. Assuming 60Hz, [200pF body capacitance](http://www.extremeelectronics.co.uk/capacitance-of-a-human-body/), and you are free floating, we get:  I = 2e5 * (2e-10*60*2*Pi) = 0.015 amps. Which is in the [dangerous range](https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html).  If you were riding in a helicopter or cherry picker, that would increase your effective body capacitance and increase the current.

&gt;The field intensity near high voltage lines is so great that it might be fatal to touch them even if you were suspended in free air. You may notice that birds can sit on lower voltage transmission lines which are 5kV to 50 kV or so, but not on 200kV+ lines.",1534475820

The current through the case to the earth in the plug is just low enough to slip under the RCD/GFCI, while when the ground fault path is via the sink the current is slightly higher and enough to trip.

It could be that fatty oils have deposited somewhere inside the oven, creating a high impedance path from live components to the case.",1591821142

Two-phase electrical power was an early 20th-century polyphase alternating current electric power distribution system. Two circuits were used, with voltage phases differing by one-quarter of a cycle, 90°. Usually circuits used four wires, two for each phase. Less frequently, three wires were used, with a common wire with a larger-diameter conductor.

1830,jimpaocga,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"**What is 1 Volt?**

If moving charge q = 1 C from one point to another, the force generating energy is A = 1 J. Then, suppose that two points are A and B in space, then we have the potential difference between A and B are 1 Volt.

And the expression is V = A / q

In particular, if the voltage at A is Va, at B is Vb, then Vab = | Va - Vb | = 0

That is the common way of understanding Volt, and there are also many paradoxes when studying current.

**Amperage**

The amount of current flowing through a surface is defined as the amount of charge traveling through that surface in a unit of time. It is usually denoted by the letter I, from the French word Intensité, meaning intensity. In SI systems, the amperage is in amperes.

I = Q / t

The average amperage over a period of time is defined as the quotient between the amount of energy transferred across the surface considered during that period and the period under consideration.

**What does amp-hours mean?**

For example: Your battery says 50Ah, 36V. That means that when you charge the battery with a current of 50 Amps, the voltage is slightly larger than 36 Volt, then you need 1 hour to fully charge the Battery.

Similarly, if you use a charger that only has 25 amps, then you need 2 hours to fully charge the Battery.",1591934405

Amperage is your flow rate. Imagine any other ""rate"" unit. Amperage is the same. 1 amp is 1 coulomb/second 

So the more energy (joules) your charges (coulombs) have the more voltage you have. And if your coulombs have more energy then they will move faster. Therefore more voltage applied means more current flowing. 

Now, energy is not the same thing as power. Power is the amount of energy delivered in a period of time.  Power is given in watts and is the amount of work done. Energy is joules (from above) therefore 1 watt is 1 joule/second.

You should be able to see that amps and watts are different. They are both units per second (rates) but what they represent is different. 

Now for the fun part where I make up a silly example. 

&gt;How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

Chucking wood is our work. Our system will produce so many ""watts"" of wood chucking power. 

The work is done by charges, woodchucks are our charges (coulomb).

Now I hope you're able to imagine that more energetic the woodchucks are able to move faster which increases the number of woodchucks per second. 

More woodchucks per second means more wood gets chucked and the system produces more power.

The ""speed"" of electicity is the current, which is a measure of charge passing a point per second. It is determined by the material's resisitvivity - this is a property of the material. Materials with low resistivity are called conductors while materials with high resistivity are called insulators. Some insulators, eg air, will insulate up to a point but with a high enough voltage they then break down and ionise and plasma forms which allows conduction.

Current itself can actually be measured in slightly different ways. Generally, we consider the effective current, but sometimes you can look at the drift current of actual electrons. The analogy often used is balls filling a narrow pipe: if you push one ball in at one end another pops out the other end almost instantly - this is the effective current. However, while the effective current is instant, the speed of the balls (electrons) themselves is much slower.

1873,RickyNut,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"The challenge is 3-fold: energy DENSITY, perverted markets, and spinning inertia.

1. Density: Fossil fuels and nuclear energy both do this well. Fossil fuels, unfortunately, have the issue of carbon. Carbon has real, tangible costs on both the environment and respiratory health. It should be taxed to account for this. Even the big oil companies now favor a carbon tax. Maybe it’s a last-ditched grab for relevance in light of swan diving stock prices? Or a way to atone for their sins of hiding the impacts of climate change they knew about in the 1970s but concealed? Who knows. Either way, they now want it.
2. Perverted markets: The government has spent decades subsidizing fossil fuels (including fracking, which made gas prices plunge). In recent years, it’s also heavily subsidized renewables (despite not having the reliability to justify it). They also setup the energy markets to favor renewable energy with renewable energy credits (RECs) which are nothing more than a shell game with money and do nothing to actually solve climate change. The government NEVER extended similar credits to nuclear power plants, which are carbon free and far more reliable than renewable energy sources. And the plants have suffered. That is wrong and needs to be fixed.
3. Spinning Inertia. This is basically the grid’s ability to stand back up after a disturbance smacks it across the face. It’s the equivalent to weight lifting. Solar and wind can’t lift weights. If a fault happens on an electric system with heavy solar, it does NOTHING to help bring the voltage back up quickly once the fault clears. It has no inertial, gravity-based energy to hit back and get the voltage up. This is what leads to what’s known as grid instability. Basically it gets smacked with a fault and can’t get back up. This is what leads to blackouts....quicker than you can blink.",1598622669

I did my masters thesis on power system inertia. The statement that solar and wind don't provide any voltage support during faults is simply incorrect. Inertia is only related to power and frequency anyway, voltage support is something else. Anyway, as the grid transitions into a new operation you are right that inertia will be reduced. However, any inertia issues are solved simply with either synthetic inertia or flywheels or other spinning mass such as synchronous condensers.

Capacity charge is for things like electrical generators, turbines, buildings, dams - basically the fixed infrastructure. 

Non-Capacity covers things like labour to service the equipment, fuel and other consumables. It is more variable than the Capacity charge.

Delivery is the cost of building and maintaining the power grid. Presumably you are in an open-market area and can choose your suppliers - the route between your chosen supplier and your house will affect this cost and a more expensive provider may end up being cheaper overall. This is one of the reasons industries that use huge amounts of power are in odd locations - there is probably a hydroelectric station closeby. Hydro power is usually very cheap, short distance means low distribution costs. Maybe zero if the factory runs it's own lines to the power plant.

Your meter is reading on a totalizer. So since the meter was installed or since the last time it rolled over, you have used 39,000kWh. This could have taken months or years. 

Your kW (10kW) reading may or may not be instantaneous. Utilities commonly charge for the peak use in a specific time period. The reading shown may be the highest load since some other time. The best way to check this is to significantly change the load by a known quantity and then see if the kW display changes to match.

Other countries have a different plug design that makes it hard to touch the exposed metal of the plugs, just because of their shape

Some places have distribution panel wide ground fault detectors, other places have it per outlet. Having it distribution panel wide is more save, as everything is protected now.

Setting things on fire is the easiest done with low voltage, as that is not likely to make a big and loud spark, scaring the person away, even a 9V battery can make a fire if shorted.

1933,tomrlutong,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Your basic concept is a little off.  Batteries don't really store free electrons.

The key is the chemical reactions between the electrolyte and the two electrodes.  The chemistry is designed so the reaction between the electrolyte and the cathode takes electrons from the electrolyte.  The reaction at the anode takes electrons from the electrolyte.

These reactions aren't very powerful, and only produce a force of a volt or so.  You can think of that as the reaction at the cathode only being strong enough to push an electron against a negative one volt charge, and at the anode only being strong enough to pull an electron out of a one positive volt hole. So, when the battery is open, this reaction quickly reaches equilibrium, and leaves a very minor charge on the electrodes, but really, the energy is stored in chemicals ""ready"" to take or loose an electron.

When the battery is connected, the extra electrons on the cathode can find their way to the anode. That lets the reaction at the cathode push more electrons and the one at the anode pull more. So, when the battery is connected, the reaction basically pumps electrons through the wire.

If you wire two batteries cathode to anode, there will be a very brief flow of current (ignored for all practical purposes).  But, since there's no return flow, extra elections will build up on the second battery, and the flow will stop as soon as the charge on the second battery is stronger than the chemical reaction can overcome.

A bit of general physics intuition: static electrical charges are very powerful, so no reaction with a one-directional flow of electricity can run for long under ordinary circumstances.

Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) (pronunciation:  redoks or  reedoks) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, two key concepts involved with electron transfer processes. Redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species. The chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced.

1964,taomark,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Because it has to be. In series connected batteries, the same current flows through each battery (first through one, then the next, then the next, and so on...). This means that each battery has the same amount of current flowing through it, and since you are increasing power with multiple batteries, the voltage must be increasing. I can't say I know the real physics answer of why this happens (it is likely pretty in-depth), but your question has inspired me to research it, and I am pretty experienced working with electricity. So your teacher is partially correct in saying you don't really *need* to know. Really, he probably doesn't know himself, but didn't want to say as much.

But the thing is, to try to get to the bottom of ""why?"" on every part of electricity would take you years, and is far beyond the scope of any one class on electricity. The core mechanics of electrical energy is based on laws of electromagnetism, which is basically at the core of all mechanics in our universe. To understand every part of it is not only not really possible, but would take a career specialized in doing so. And even at elite levels of studying such things, there are times where they just have to go, ""Well, it works that way just because it does.""

And to clarify your question here, you should be thinking of your lightbulbs in terms of resistance, not voltage. There isn't really such a thing as a ""2 volt lightbulb"", except a bulb that is rated to handle up to 2 volts. Knowing that doesn't tell you anything about your circuit. You need to know how many ohms the lightbulb is, and instead of even thinking about lightbulbs, you can simplify it and just think of it as resistors.

And how exactly the electricity ""knows"" that there are more bulbs in the circuit, and doesn't just drop the voltage to 0 at the first load, is something that takes a lot of prerequisite understanding to really grasp. But it's a fundamental property that loads in series in a closed circuit will split voltage proportionally based on their resistance. 

So if you are applying 4 volts to a series of loads, you can know that the voltage will drop to 0 by the time it's done. How much it drops at each load depends on that load's resistance, relative to the total resistance of the circuit. In other words, each load is going to get a piece of the total voltage, and how much it gets is based on how much resistance each load has. 

If you have 3 loads, one is 5 ohms, one is 3 ohms, and one is 2 ohms, your total resistance in the 4v circuit is 10 ohms. Using Ohm's law (current = voltage/resistance), then you know the current in the circuit is 4/10 = 0.4 amps. Now knowing the current, you can calculate the voltage at each load by multiplying the current by the resistance of that load (Ohm's law). It just so happens that the voltage at each load will be proportional to what percentage of the total resistance it has:

5 ohms is 50% of 10, so you will read 50% of the total applied voltage across that load (4 * 0.5 = 2v). Or, 0.4A * 5 Ohms = 2v

3 ohms is 30% of 10, so you will read 30% of the total applied voltage across that one (4 * 0.3 = 1.2v). Or, 0.4A * 3 Ohms = 1.2v

2 ohms is 20% of 10, so you will read 20% of the total voltage across that one (4 * 0.2 = 0.8v) Or, 0.4A * 2 Ohms = 0.8v

Does that make sense? If your total applied voltage was 40 volts instead of 4, then each load would see 10x the voltage, but the relationships between them would be the same. 

Your example with the 3v and 2v bulbs doesn't really make sense to me, though. If they were 3 ohms and 2 ohms, then the 3 ohm load would have 3/5, or 60% of the total voltage (2.4v), and the 2 ohm load would have 2/5, or 40% (1.6v). The order in which they occur in the circuit does not have any effect on it.",1540208704
1965,dbuckley,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"So, you have a 4V battery, and a pair of identical 2V lamps in series, and (take my word on this for a moment), when the circuit is completed you have 2V across each lamp and each lamp is glowing at full brilliance.

Just to bend your mind a bit: Now imagine instead of 2V lamps we had 50V lamps, and keep the 4V battery.  Now logic dictates that with only 4V available, those 50V lamps will never glow at full brilliance, hell, they likely wont glow at all.  But the voltage across each bulb will still be 2V!

What gives?

When thinking about this sort of circuit, the ""voltage"" the lamp says it wants or uses isn't important, what is important is the resistance of the lamps.  There are formulas that relate voltage and resistance and lamp brilliance, but lets ignore all that for the moment, and just think about resistance.  This is important because those lamps might not be lamps, they might be heaters or motors or something, doesn't matter; what matters is that they are a conductor of electricity, and all real conductors have resistance, resistance being the property that makes it more difficult for the flow of electricity, and resistance is measured in Ohms, named after a long dead scientist who figured this stuff out.

The two identical lamps are in series.  When resistances (which is what lamps are) are connected in series, then the resistances (measured in Ohms) add.  When two identical resistances are in series, then the resistances double.  So you could replace your two lamps in series with one lamp with twice as much resistance and end up with the same amount of light.

Another dead bloke called Kirchhoff also has a couple of laws, one being (in retrospect) blindingly obvious; that the sum of the currents entering a point must equal the sum of the currents leaving that point.  In the context of your question, that means if you measure the current flowing at any point in the circuit, the current will always be the same, as there is only one path the current can take around the circuit.

That chap Ohm I mentioned earlier, he's famous for [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law).  Ohm's law relates current, voltage and resistance.  Know any two, you can calculate the third.

To calculate voltage, Ohms Law tells us the formula is Current, measured in Amps, times Resistance, measured in ohms.  V = I x R.  Yep, I is current.

So with two identical lamps, each lamp has the same resistance.  We know from Kirchhoff  that the current is the same at every point in the circuit.  So if we do Ohms law on each lamp, it turns out that the current and resistance are the same for each lamp, so the voltage across each lamp must be the same.  Which is why both lamps glow equally.  And why it isn't the case that all the energy is used on the first lamp with nothing left for the second.

&gt; Also, if I had a 3v light and a 2v light connected in a series circuit (with the 3v bulb first.) would the voltage across the first bulb be 3v and only 1v across the second bulb (assuming we still used the same 4v battery.) if not then why?

We know by now that the voltage of the lamp isn't important, it is the resistance of the lamps that matter.  But to allow us to answer the question, I'm going to put in some numbers that might make sense for a battery of 4V and a 3V and 2V lamp.  Lets assume that the 2V lamp has a resistance of 2 Ohms, and the 3V lamp a resistance of 3 Ohms.

What you are stumbling around here is a really important concept in electricity, a thing called a *potential divider*.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider)  [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_hPrz7rs34).  A potential divider is, basically, two resistances in series, and the maths that works out potential dividers is really important, and is actually not that hard, its just division and multiplication, and is about ratios.

When the two resistances were identical, then the sums are easy; half the voltage appears across each resistor.  When they are not identical, then we use potential divider math to work out what the voltages are.

The general formula is Vout = Vin x R2 / (R1 + R2) where R1 is the ""first"" or 'top"" resistor when the circuit is drawn with the resistors top to bottom, and Vout is the voltage across the lower resistor.

To prove it works, lets try it with two identical resistances like the two lamps:

Vout = 4V x 2 / (2 + 2) = 4V x 2 / 4 = 2V

So it works.  With the two dissimilar lamps, lets put the 3V lamp at the top (R1), and the 2V lamp below it (R2).  So the 3 Ohm resistor at the top, and the 2 ohm resistor below it, and still the 4V battery.  To calculate the voltage across the lower resistor:

Vout = 4V x 2 / (2 + 3) = 4V x 2 / 6 = 1.33V

So the lower resistor has 1.33V across it, and the upper has the remaining voltage (4V - 1.33V) 2.67 volts across it.

1966,ferrybig,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It depends on the motor design.

An [universal motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_motor) motor uses electricity to make a magnetic field. This motor *won't* produce electricity when you spin the shaft.

1967,Joker1337,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Ok, I'll take a crack at this.

Let's say what voltage is first.  Voltage is the potential ability of electricity to do something.

Now lets say what current is.  Current is how many electrons are moving at a specific point in time.

So you can have voltage without current.  Voltage can be present in pent up and not moving electrons.  You cannot have current without voltage.  Voltage must be present for electrons to move.  Voltage is used up as electrons move through things and created by specific things (batteries, generators, etc.)

Once electrons move, they must move in a circle (circuit.)  So the same number of electrons will move through everything in a simple series circuit like the one you describe.  No component skips getting electrons through it.

So let's think about your circuit: battery to lamp 1 to lamp 2 to battery again.

Your second lamp has to have voltage across it because it has current. The electrons do not get stuck in it.  So what voltage is it?

Lamps aren't rated only by voltage.  We also include power ratings - which can be used to work out current at the given voltage.  The current varies as available voltage varies.  Let's say it's proportional for simplicity, although this isn't common in lamps.  So half the voltage, half the current; double the voltage, double the current.

Let's build the circuit.  Set the battery down.  The battery creates voltage.  No current exists until you hook the positive and negative terminals up.  

Let's hook them up to one lamp.  Now the lamp has the full voltage of the battery and all of the current because it is in series.  4V and let's say 1A.

Let's hook up the second lamp in series.  Now each lamp has half the voltage but still all of the current.  If you like, think of this as making the lamp into a bigger lamp and considering what happens to the voltage halfway through the bigger lamp.  So 2V for lamp 1 and 2V for lamp 2.  But remember that the current changes as the voltage decreases.  0.5A in each lamp.

Let's unhook the second lamp and then reconnect it in parallel.  Now each lamp has all of the voltage and each lamp has as much current as it had when only the first lamp was hooked up.  This is analogous to your home, where all of the outlets are the same voltage because they are in parallel. 4V.  The battery supplies the current each lamp wants: 1A.  But there are two lamps, so in total they use 2A.

Off the shelf generators and inverters won't be set up for 120vDC, so not sure why this is useful to your application.

1984,operator-jay,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I recommend calculating this way...

1\.  Find total Watts.

2\.  Find 'VA' (volt amps).  This is very similar to Watts but a bit more 'true' when it comes to calculating Amps.  

2a.  Fudge VA up a little to account for 'low power factor' loads (typically motors).

2b.  Fudge VA down a little to account for load diversity.  Equipment does not always run at full load.  Equipment does not all run at the same time.

2c.  Doing the above gives you your 'Demand VA'.  This is the amount of load that is likely to be running for any extended period of time (say 15 mins or an hour; loading that is higher than this but for short intervals does not effect your main breaker or your wiring etc very much).  This is the number we want, in order to calculate if you have too many Amps on your main breaker or not

3\.  Find Amps by dividing VA by voltage (in your case 380 * 1.732 because it is a three phase service).  This is your Amps if the load was perfectly divided amongst the three phases of your service.

4\.  If the Amps is less than 80% of your main breaker rating then it should work fine.

SO:

1\.  Add up Watts, this equals 16,390W.

2a &amp; 2b &amp; 2c We can say your Demand VA is about equal to your calculated Watts.  You do not have a ton of motor load which would drive this up.  I suspect your Demand VA is actually less than your Watts, but using your Watts number works out fine so we'll just stick with it.

3\.  Amps = 16,390 / (380*1.732) = 25 A.

4\.  This is quite a bit lower than the 32A continuous current capability of your main service breaker (80% of 40A rated value) so you will be fine.  You'll want your loads to be reasonably balanced amongst the three phases.  Have your electrician do this.  I think you'd be unlucky to have your load so badly balanced that there is a problem (i.e., main breaker tripping).

Comments:

You do not have any load in here for heating or air conditioning (just 1000W for ventilation).  Maybe that is powered elsewhere or maybe Estonia is so nice these are not needed.

You do not have any load allowance for receptacles and miscellaneous.  You're probably still fine as you can handle a few kW of additional load on your service.

You have only 3,000 W for electric heating appliances.  If you have (or will have) other appliances (cooking;  hot water; etc.) in your cafe that are electric heat, you need to add them in.  If you have gas-fired equipment then they are not much electric load and can kinda be ignored.

PS ... It is not quite correct to just add up Amps as your electricians may have done.  This would work if your loads were all three phase, but they are not.  It is better to add up Watts (or VA) then convert to Amps as above.

The NEC handbook also has this commentary:

*In the early years of the NEC, concerns over the effect of electric current on metal water piping created some uncertainty as to whether metal water piping systems should be used as grounding electrodes. To address those concerns, the electrical industry and the waterworks industry formed a committee to evaluate the use of metal underground water piping systems as grounding electrodes. Based on its findings, the committee issued an authoritative report on the subject. The International Association of Electrical Inspectors published the report, Interim Report of the American Research Committee on Grounding, in January 1944 (reprinted March 1949). This report serves as part of the basis for the continuation of the practice of using metal water pipes as part of the grounding electrode system.*

It gets even more complicated because your internal resistance is super low, only your skin has a high resistance, so a path through you (and possibly across your heart) could be the path of least resistance. Then you go into defib, and yes, quite probably die.  The strange thing is, higher current across the heart can apparently be *less* lethal, as it clamps the heart shut instead of causing the muscles to vibrate.  You would still need to be resuscitated, so without immediate intervention you still die.

2034,taomark,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"""A volt"" isn't really a thing, per say; it's the unit of measurement for measuring how much work a coulomb (or a unit charge) is able to do, or you could think of it has how much energy the unit charge has. It gets this energy from the electric field created by the charge potential difference.

Electromagnetic force is one of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe, and is thus not easy to break down into further fundamentals in order to understand. It's like gravity, except we don't deal with it personally on a daily basis. Well, we do... but not on a macro scale that we're consciously aware of.

A good example I've heard is to think of charge potential as altitude. If you looked at a topographical map, you would see the lines following the slopes. Those lines basically represent another fundamental force (gravity). You could see that going from an area of high altitude to low altitude would gain you a lot of energy, given to you by gravity. It is analogous to the electric field created by having a voltage potential. As the unit of charge moves across the field, it gains energy (voltage). The degree of difference between the potentials determines just how much energy the unit charge will gain. 

If the unit of charge *uses* that energy, then it will have less, much like if water flowing down a mountain is used to turn a turbine, the water loses energy.

And much like the topo map, you need *two* points of altitude to get a voltage. You can have something at 8,000 feet, but if the surrounding land is also at 8,000 feet then there is no real energy to be gained.

2038,taomark,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"It's electrostatic energy, and that's really as much as I know. Electrostatics gets pretty complicated, and is an entire academic discipline in it's own right. And if you look into it, you'll find that it is mostly observations of observed phenomena and laws, rather than a properly elucidated explanation of what all of this stuff **is**, for you to wrap your head around.

How is energy ""expressed"" in anything? What even *is* ""energy""?

Think about the potential energy your body has by standing at the edge of a cliff. Do you really ""have"" that energy? Does it exist in your body? If you step away from the cliff, does it go away? There will obviously be some kinetic energy from the moment you step off the cliff, but was that energy there the whole time? Most would probably say yes, it was there in the form of potential energy, but how was is that potential energy expressed? Is it in a field inside your body? It's not in your velocity, or your mass, or your temperature, so where is it? 

This is a question for quantum physics and is (among other things) at the forefront of the cutting edge of physics research. I mean, we just *barely* know what an electron even is. The current leading theory is that the true nature of an electron's existence is as a field of probability, expressed as a wave function, that only collapses into a particle at certain times, like when it is observed. And there is no real way to know exactly where it's going to be or what it's spin is, until forcing it to collapse, aside from guesses based on probability. So how on earth does that electron ""move"" down a wire? How does it even have velocity, let alone energy? If it exists as a wave function, does it have mass? Does it only have mass as a particle? Where did the mass come from? Where does it go? What even is mass? Does it always have electrostatic energy? Does the electrostatic energy affect its state as a wave function? Or does it affect the way in which it collapses? The exact mechanics of how electrostatic energy really works, and how it moves around, how it's stored, where it comes from, etc., as well as those other questions I posed, is why we are smashing atoms apart in particle colliders.  

There may already be some answers to these things, but most of them are not completely proven, and you'll find other researchers who might disagree.

However, to my understanding, an electron (or rather, a charge carrier), interacts with the energy that is transferred through an electric field. Whether the charge carrier ""has"" the energy, or, what I actually think is more accurate, the energy in the field is being used to move the charge carrier, is ultimately irrelevant to most things you would need to look at, maybe with the exception of very precise microscopic circuitry, I suppose. 

I work as an electrician and 99.9% of other electricians I've worked with, been around, or talked to, don't have any idea what electrostatic force is. Most of them think of electricity as electrons flowing through a wire like little marbles in a tube, or water in a pipe. That model is good enough for most things they need to do, and to *really* get to the bottom of what's going on, you have to move through progressively more complicated models, until eventually you get to where the leading physicists are scratching their heads and trying to figure it out for themselves.

It's a hard realization to come to, because you sound kind of like me, in that you're not satisfied with most explanations, and you want to know what's really going on at the bottom of it all. Unfortunately, you'll probably have to wait on some things, because even our leading experts don't know. 

This isn't to say that everything I've told you is the furthest extent of what's going on; quite the contrary. I'm not a particle physicist, and don't really know much about point charges or field theory or any of that stuff.

Edit: If the ground wire goes bad you could still get shocked during a ground fault, no?  Is a neutral connection going bad more likely than a ground connection going bad?

Second edit: I guess in my brain I wasn’t distinguishing a bad neutral + bootleg ground from a ground fault event (hot wire touching the appliance case) which are distinctly different events.

If the neutral goes bad in a bootleg ground setup, the circuit will close through your body if you touch the appliance case because the connection back to the transformer has been broken somewhere, and the appliance case has been bonded to the neutral wire (to serve dual purpose as ground). In a correct setup we don’t bond the appliance case to neutral, we only connect it to the ground wire. So if the neutral goes bad, the appliance simply stops functioning. The case isn’t bonded to neutral, so the current won’t seek a return path to ground through an unsuspecting user.

Power lines are made to be as low resistance as possible, so unless something even less resistant comes along, the electricity will just stay within the line. In addition to the already low resistance of the line, they are also insulated, which creates a huge disincentive for the electricity to pass through to the outside of the power line.

A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.

Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires.

They often separate the supply and distribution as well, because of what’s called “decoupling” which is the idea that for the sake of energy efficiency and sustainability, you don’t want power companies to be grossly incentivized to encourage their customers to consume as much power as possible in order to maximize the company’s profits.

2087,wbeaty,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"No such thing.  (It's watts times seconds, or watt-seconds.   Watt-hours, watts times hours.)

After all, ""Watt"" is a name for joules of energy flowing per second.   Really, we don't need the word ""watt"" at all, just say ""joules/sec energy-flow.""    Kilojoules per second instead of kilowatts.

Power is a rate.   Power just means energy-flow.  If a light-bulb is running at one watt, that just means it's sending out one joule of energy per second, emitted as visible light and perhaps IR light.   One joule of energy is the same thing as one watt-second of energy.

On the other hand, if you know the joules-per-second (the watts,) and you know the number of seconds, then rather than calculating the joules, you can calculate the watt-seconds, which means exactly the same thing as joules.   ""Watt-second"" means ""joules/sec times second"" ...which just means joules.

A kWH is the same thing as 3600 kilojoules of energy, or 3.6megajoules, since one hour is 3600 seconds.   That's kilowatts times hours, not kilowatts per hour.

Car Charger:

Any time you convert electricity between AC or DC or even DC to DC you do loose a small amount of energy as waste heat.

2090,moldboy,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Your question doesn't quite make sense.  That's because the unit 'watt' is a rate, a rate of energy per time. Just like how speed is a rate of distance per time. If your car consistently drives 60 miles per hour how many miles per hour does it go per hour? That doesn't really make sense either.

I suspect you're asking about watt-hours rather than watts per hour because that's how electricity is metered. Your power bill will charge you for a certain amount of kilowatt-hours consumed. Which is the same thing as a thousand watt hours.

Back to the car analogy, you're a taxi driver and you charge $1 per mile. If you drive 60 miles an hour for 2 hours it's pretty easy to figure out that you've gone 120 miles and that your bill will be $120.  In electrical terms instead of saying you charge $1 per mile you would say that you charged $1 for every 'mile per hour'-hour.  Then you could say that you drove 60 mile per hour for 2 hours or 120 'miles per hour'-hours.

In your case the computer consumes 0.3 kilowatt-hours every hour. So if you left the computer on for 10 hours a day it would consume 3 kilowatt-hours hours every day.

Most higher power commercial/industrial devices include PFC, because their main customers are built for Apparant Power.  But, the main load in fog machines is resistive, heating a coil of resistance wire to vaporize the glycerin.  Along with a pretty small fan and some control electronics that's pretty much it.

I disagree with other comment that simply measuring ""heat"" arbitrarily will give you a good indicator though.  Unless you had accurate readings of every component your data is worthless.  You can use Kill-A-Watt, or comparable device, that plugs into an outlet then you plug your device to measure into it.  They can give you all kinds of info, and you can use it to compare power used over 15 minutes (including turn on) compared to turning on for a few minutes, then off for 10, then back on.  

As a side note, older TVs and electrical appliances used way more power not just while running, but also turning on.  When radios and TVs operated by Valve Tubes, they required a ton of power to warm-up the tubes, but even once warmed up still would use more power than our modern ones.  There's exceptions of course, a 10"" B&amp;W with a single 2-watt speaker will probably have used less power than a 80"" with 7.1 built-in, but the difference wouldn't be that large.

If you're concerned about saving power, but not wanting to buy a Kill-A-Watt and measure everything, as a general rule you're better off turning things off when not in use.  Even if sometimes you turn it on 10 minutes later, overall the habit will save money versus leaving them on regularly.  Also, going into settings and reducing brightness(or using adaptive brightness), turning off ""standby"" modes(which reduce turn on time by keeping everything but the screen always on), and unplugging DC power adapters and chargers when not in use as well will have a noticeable improvement on energy costs.

2127,acme_mail_order,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"&gt;what is the current of a standard third rail?

Same as the current in your wall outlet. None, until you apply a load to it. Then the current is whatever the load needs, up to the limit of the power supply serving it.

&gt;why do people still think it's the volts that kill you rather than the amps

Because you need both.

Current is the result of voltage and resistance. The current required to stop your heart is quite small - a 9 volt battery will do it. But your skin has too much resistance for 9 volts to really get anywhere. Apply a 9 volt battery directly across your heart using salt-water soaked sponges and you're done - obviously that's quite difficult to do outside of a serious operating room, and most heart surgeons don't leave spare batteries rolling about.

Increase the voltage applied to your dry skin and you will eventually notice a tingle as the current increases with said voltage. If the electrical path crosses something important you will reach a point where that something stops working. Several hundred volts from knee to ankle is going to hurt a bit, may permanently damage your leg, but you have a rather low risk of actually dying from it. You can also stand on a third rail with one foot and come to no harm - between your shoe providing extra insulation and the current having nowhere to go, there is no circuit beyond the tiny amount your body can absorb (look up ""capacitor"" for details there).

Step on the third rail at the same time you step on something grounded, especially in the rain, and things will not go well for you. 600-1500 volts can go through quite a bit, the available current on a train line is thousands of amps, and you only need a small amount going to odd places to ruin your day.

The extremely high voltage devices you mentioned elsewhere can deliver voltage but not current. The ""standard police taser"" runs on a couple of batteries using fancy electronics to boost the voltage. But as voltage goes up, available current goes down given the same supply - the total power remains constant. Common batteries can easily deliver a few amps at 1.5 volts. But theres no way a few AA cells will deliver a couple of amps at 50,000 volts. That's enough energy to melt a steel bar. And for complicated reasons, high frequency electricity as used in a taser doesn't burrow deep enough to cause internal injuries. Look up ""alternating current skin effect"" for that one.

And for something really good, [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGoaXZwFlJ4) about high voltage power line maintenance.",1597646419

2154,petEEy,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"This is the correct answer. Where you charge your phone is irrelevant. The bottleneck is the 5V converter.

The amps limit specifically exists in in the 5V converter. The 12V DC and 120V AC put out more than enough amps to fry your phone's battery. Phones can only charge so fast, or else they start fires.

Your phone has a amp limit. If the converter can't keep up with that limit, the voltage will drop, and the phone will charge slower.

The article's bit about a phone draining your battery is wrong. The phone will stop charging when at full battery life. An iPhone 8 has about 7 watt-hour battery. A standard car battery has 540 watt-hours. Compare this to leaving on your headlights. A 35 watt bulb headlight will use 35 watts-hours in a hour (simple math!), or x5 what a phone will use before it quits charging, but there are two of them. Two 35 watt bulbs will spend an entire iPhone 8's battery life in 6 minutes.

The second question is can be understood with units. Your battery holds energy. Energy is power over time. A unit of power is a watt. A common unit of energy is a watt-hour, or a watt multiplied by one hour. The actually unit is Jule, but electricians don't go to college so things get simplified.

A watt is 1 amp at 1 volt. So 1 amp coming out of 12V is 12 watts (1x12V). 1 amps coming out of 120V is 120 watts. 1 amp coming out of your house outlet is ten times more power than 1 amp coming from your car's cigarette lighter port. Most house breaks are 15 amps, so you would actually be able to draw 1,800 watts max (15x120). Most 12V plugs have at least a 5amp fuse, in which case the max power is 60 watts (5x12).

Some phone can charge at 2 amps. 2 amps at 5V is 10 watts. A 7 watt-hour phone will take 42 minutes to fully charge (7/10*60).

Again, the bottle neck is the 5V converter. 10 watts is far less than either plug's max. If the 5V converter can only put out 1 amp, that's all the phone will get. The phone would have to settle for 5 watts, and take 84 minutes to charge (7/5*60).

It used to be true, back in the days of vacuum tubes and large transformers. Thermal cycling was also an issue - turn it off and on repeatedly and it will fail sooner than by leaving it on. For a similar reason, office buildings in the 1970s used to leave the flourescent lights on all night - the power cost was less than the replacement cost if you turned them off and on constantly.

Vacuum tubes, CRT monitors (just a big vacuum tube) and 8 foot T12 magnetic-ballast flourescent lights have all but disappeared from today's world and the old methods need to go away with them. 

Today's stuff is never really ""off"" unless you literally pull the plug - the power supply consumes such a small amount of power on standby that you would need an expensive meter to measure it, and the device is unlikely to be cycle-limited.

The startup surge for any domestic product made this century is nowhere close to being a noticeable charge on your power bill. You would have to hammer the on-off button constantly to do that, and then replacing the button will cost more than the electricity.",1597937518

This is also a good way to overheat your motor.

Seriously, you need to stop giving advice that can kill people. Going through your comment history it seems you know just enough to be dangerous.

A typical home circuit uses three wires. A line, or hot wire, a neutral, or grounded conductor, and a ground or grounding conductor. Electricity flows (for all intents and purposes) from the source to the point of use on the hot wire, and returns to the source on the neutral wire. 

A GFCI constantly monitors the difference in current between the hot and neutral wires. If a difference of more than 4-5 milliamps is detected (meaning electricity is *not* returning to the source on the neutral wire but rather by some other means) then it will trip.

A GFCI can be used in place of a two wire receptacle only if it is labeled as ""NO EQUIPMENT GROUND"".

Varying the field can adjust the line current phase from inductive, through resistive, to capacitive. Permanent magnet DC simply follow a speed proposional to applied voltage, since the field is always fixed, even at zero applied voltage. I know all the different motors have different characteristics, but some things are the same for any type. Like they accelerate until the back EMF equals the applied. They all can be generators. In old texts, they often referred to an ""electrical machine"", to reflect that the same device can be run as a generator or motor.

In building wiring, multiway switching is the interconnection of two or more electrical switches to control an electrical load (often, but not always, lighting) from more than one location. For example, this allows lighting in a hallway, stairwell or large room to be controlled from multiple locations.

While a ""normal"" light switch needs to be only a single pole, single throw (SPST) switch, multiway switching requires the use of switches that have one or more additional contacts and two or more wires must be run between the switches. When the load is controlled from only two points, single pole, double throw (SPDT) switches are used.

Imagine that a power supply is a tank full of water that always stays at a certain level, refilling instantly whenever water is lost. The weight of the water, or rather, the pressure that it applies to the bottom of the tank represents voltage. Now imagine there are multiple valves under the tank which can tap out the water, and you turn one until it releases one liter per second(current). Now imagine you were to turn another valve by exactly the same amount. Would the first valve start releasing less water because there are now two valves tapping out at the same time? Nope. Because the tank instantly refills lost water, the pressure that is being applied is always the same regardless of how many taps are opened on the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, real life power supplies can't supply infinite energy, just like how a water tank couldn't be refilled instantly regardless of load.",1548963016
2214,TWeaKoR,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"Electronic/electrical engineer here, people are touching on it but not quite getting it right.

Basically, in a conductor or metal the material already has electrons in a conductive band; that is, there is an energy level where a number of electrons can reside in each atom, but this band is not full. This means that electrons can freely move from the conductive band of one atom to the conductive band of another.

A quick aside, a semiconductor is a material that is normally not conductive, but can be made to conduct. The simplest is a p-n diode, where when you put a high enough voltage across it you'll get current to flow with minimal voltage drop, while if you apply the voltage the other way you get no current flow (unless the voltage is too high, then the diode will breakdown and the magic smoke that powers it will escape). In a semiconductor the voltage gives electrons in the valance band a little bit more energy so they can move into the conductive band, and thus move to other atoms along the material. There's a kind of push and pull effect, so when one electron leaves another will arrive, and when one arrives another will leave.

However, electrons don't really move that fast. They do move fast, but nowhere near as fast as you might think. The classic analogy is to think of balls going through a pipe single file. When you push one ball in, another comes out the other end immediately, however the speed of each individual ball is much lower. The same is true of electrons, although really this is more relevant to transients or AC circuits.",1548965801

2221,encaseme,Electricity,t5_2qzwz,"I'll give the tl;dr first: basically (IMO, summing up the general consensus), unless the electric field is strong enough, or very high frequency (so-called 'ionizing' radiation), you don't need to worry about it. Very few places in everyday life have powerful or high-frequency enough electric fields to be concerned about.

The long answer: to start, it's not woohoo, it's a valid question; and being concerned for your health is a good mindset IMO; asking questions rather than just jumping to conclusions or fearmongering is the right way to go, so congrats on that to start :)

The World Health Organization (WHO, an agency of the United Nations) is a reasonably-well-regarded institution on human health; here's their conclusion: https://www.who.int/peh-emf/about/WhatisEMF/en/index1.html

The NIH (a US government institution) also says similarly: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/emf/index.cfm

The American cancer society: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phone-towers.html

The two above sources are ""big government"" based groups, so take that into account before blindly trusting their conclusions as well. Here's an ""independent"" sort of website source that essentially agrees: http://www.emfandhealth.com/ and check additional resources to verify/validate. 

Home microwave ovens can be powerful of course (they have to be powerful enough to heat food), but the microwaves are easily contained within the metal box. Even the ""screen"" on the front of the microwave is (from the point of view of the microwaves) impenetrable. That being said, microwave ovens can be made poorly and/or have defects that allow microwave radiation to escape the oven box. The results of this could be localized heating of substances in the vicinity of the leak, but no different from what it would do to microwaved food - could cause burns in the worst case scenario. Also once you're a short distance away from the leak the energy will be distributed over a much larger area and basically be unnoticeable. If you ran a microwave with the failsafes disabled and the door off, it would just make you feel warm/ho

Cell phones typically output &lt;5 watts of energy over the radio; which is a relatively small amount - large AM/FM radio towers can broadcast up to 50,000 watts of energy (of course you're much closer to your cell phone, but for comparison sake). 

Another thing to remember is your body is _constantly_ bathed in all sorts of EMF radiation, it's literally everywhere and inescapable in modern life. Even in ancient life, the earth's magnetic field is always there, and electrical fields are naturally present/generated by the body and other living organisms. Life evolved in the presence of EMF, so it's likely that life is able to cope with it without an issue. ",1549561097

There is also a good chance that your local utility is shifting resources away from maintaining and improving your local distribution network  in order to focus on other things. Like renewable energy, reliability of higher voltage networks, cutting costs, etc. If this is the case, your reliability might get worse.

In your situation, four six-hour outages in a year seems really excessive. (Unless these are huge storms that are blowing power lines over, or you live way out in the country.)

I would also check your appliances.

You may as well have unplugged the fridge altogether because now, your hot apartment is forcing your fridge to work harder, thus consuming more energy. Just an example but something to think about.
